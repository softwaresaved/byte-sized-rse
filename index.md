## Byte-sized RSE

Byte-sized RSE is a series of standalone mini training materials providing key research software skills in around 1-1.5 hour. It has been originally been developed and run by the [UNIVERSE-HPC](https://www.universe-hpc.ac.uk/) project. There have been 3 [Byte-sized RSE series](https://www.universe-hpc.ac.uk/events/byte-sized-rse/) so far, each with a number of episodes - some of which are documented in this project:

- Integrated Development Environments
- Code Style & Linting
- Intermediate Git
- Code Review
- Unit Testing Code

### Target Audience

Research Software Engineers (RSEs), reseachers and postgraduates involved in computational research who already posses foundational computational skills and who are now:
- looking for quick refreshers, tips, or wanting to improve the sustainability or quality of their research code and are keen on continuous learning without heavy time investment.
- interested in advancing their skills and learning best practices for software in research.
- seeking digestible content to bridge the gap between research and software and benefiting from short-form RSE tips/tools to improve their research workflows.

Each episode is standalone, although it may require some prerequisite knowledge clearly described at the start, along with its own setup instructions.
