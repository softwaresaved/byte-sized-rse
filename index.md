# Byte-sized RSE

Byte-sized RSE is a series of standalone mini training materials providing key research software skills in around 1-1.5 hour. It has been originally been developed and run by the [UNIVERSE-HPC](https://www.universe-hpc.ac.uk/) project. There have been 3 [Byte-sized RSE series](https://www.universe-hpc.ac.uk/events/byte-sized-rse/) so far, each with a number of episodes - some of which are documented in this project:

- Integrated Development Environments
- Code Style & Linting
- Intermediate Git
- Code Review
- Unit Testing Code

::: prereq
Each episode is standalone, although it may require some prerequisite knowledge which is clearly described at the beginning. Episodes start with a setup for that episode, introduction and motivation, which is then followed by a practical hands-on part.
