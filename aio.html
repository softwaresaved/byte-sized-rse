<hr class="half-width">
<p>Let’s start by running VSCode now on our machines, so run it now. How
you run VSCode will differ depending on which operating system you have
installed.</p>
<p>TODO: add screenshot of opening vscode for first time</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll likely see is a “Welcome” page. You may find
it asks you which kind of theme you’d like - you can select from either
a dark or light theme.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="navigating-around-vscode">Navigating Around VSCode<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#navigating-around-vscode"></a>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>So let’s take a look at the application. You’ll see some icons on the
left side, which give you access to its key features. Hovering your
mouse over each one will show a tooltip that names that feature:</p>
<p>TODO: add screenshot with highlighted icons for what we’ll cover
here</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Explorer</code> - the top one is a file navigator, or
explorer - we can use this to open existing folders containing program
files.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Search</code> - the next one down is a search capability,
so you can search for things (and replace them with other text) over
your code files.</p></li>
<li>
<p><code>Source control</code> - this gives you access to source
code control, which includes Git version control functionality. This
feature means you can do things like clone Git repositories (for
example, from GitHub), add and commit files to a repository, things like
that.</p>
<div id="callout1" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Callout</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>If you’re not familiar with Git, that’s totally fine - you don’t have
to use this feature, although it’s worth looking into using version
control for writing your code. Version control Systems like Git allow
you to manage your code by storing it - and all the changes you make to
it - within a repository hosted elsewhere, for example, on GitHub.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p><code>Run and Debug</code> - this allows you to run programs you
write in a special way with a debugger, which allows you to check the
state of your program as it is running, which is very useful and we’ll
look into later.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Extensions</code> - which we’ll look into right now, allows
you to install extensions to VSCode to extend its functionality in some
way.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other features and ways to access them, and we’ll
cover key ones throughout this lesson.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="installing-extensions">Installing Extensions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#installing-extensions"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Extensions are a major strength of VSCode. Whilst VSCode appears
quite lightweight, and presents a simple interface (particularly
compared to many other IDEs!), this is quite deceptive. You can extend
its functionality in many different ways. or example, installing support
for other languages, greater support for version control, there’s even
support for working with databases, and so on. There are literally tens
of thousands of possible extensions now.</p>
<p>Now VSCode already comes with built-in support for JavaScript,
including TypeScript and node.js, but also has extensions for other
languages too (C++, C#, Java, PHP, Go, and many others). Installing a
language extension will allow you to do more things with that particular
language in VSCode, as we’ll see now.</p>
<p>Let’s install an extension now:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Firstly, select the extensions icon first, then type in Python into
the search box at the top, and it’ll give you a list of all
python-related extensions.</li>
<li>Select the one which says <code>Python</code> from Microsoft. This
is the Microsoft official Python extension.</li>
<li>Then select <code>Install</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>It might take a minute - you can see a sliding blue line in the top
left to indicate it’s working. Once complete, you should see a couple of
“Welcome” windows introducing you to two of its key features - support
for Python and Jupyter notebooks. If you use Jupyter notebooks, which is
a way of writing Python programs that you can run line by line from
within an editor as you write the program, you may find this useful.</p>
<p>For now, let’s configure this extension for our Python development,
and to do that, we need to do is tell VSCode which Python installation
on our machine we’d like it to use. In the Python Welcome window, select
<code>Select a Python interpreter</code>, and then
<code>Select Python interpreter</code>. You may find you have many
installations of Python, or only have one. Try to select one later than
3.8 if you can. Then select <code>Mark done</code>, and close the
welcome windows.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="a-sample-project">A Sample Project<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-sample-project"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>FIXME: copy code-style-example to softwaresaved’s organisation</p>
<p>Next, let’s obtain some example Python and edit it from within
VSCode. So first, you can download the example code we’ll use from <a href="https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/code-style-example/releases/tag/v1.0.0" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/code-style-example/releases/tag/v1.0.0</a>,
either as a <code>.zip</code> or <code>.tar.gz</code> compressed archive
file. If you’re unsure, download the <code>.zip</code> file. Then,
extract all the files from the archive into a convenient location. You
should see files contained within a new directory named
<code>code-style-example-1.0.0</code>.</p>
<p>Now we need to load the code into VSCode to see it. You can do this
in a couple of ways, either:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Select the <code>Source control</code> icon from the middle of the
icons on the left navigation bar. You should see an
<code>Open Folder</code> option, so select that.</li>
<li>Select the <code>File</code> option from the top menu bar, and
select <code>Open Folder...</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In either case, you should then be able to use the file browser to
locate the directory with the files you just extracted, and then select
<code>Open</code>. Note that we’re looking for the <em>folder</em> that
contains the files, not a specific file.</p>
<div id="what-about-using-git-version-control" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="what-about-using-git-version-control" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">What about using Git Version Control?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>If your system has the Git version control system installed, you may
see a <code>Clone Repository</code> option here too. If you are familiar
with Git and wish to use this option instead, select this option instead
and enter the repository’s location as
<code>https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/code-style-example</code>. Then
use the file browser that is presented to find a convenient location to
store the cloned code and click on
<code>Select as Repository Destination</code>, then select
<code>Open</code> when ‘Would you like to open the cloned repository?’
appears.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>You’ll then likely be presented with a window asking whether you
trust the authors of this code. In general, it’s a good idea to be at
least a little wary, since you’re obtaining code from the internet, so
be sure to check your sources! Be careful here - I found on Windows the
“Trust” option appears on the left, whilst on Mac, it appears on the
right! In this case, feel free to trust the repository! You’ll then see
the explorer present you with some files in a small window (or pane) on
the left you can use to navigate and find files.</p>
<p>So far within VSCode we have downloaded some code from a repository
and opened a folder. Whenever we open a folder in VSCode, this is
referred to as a “Workspace” - essentially, a collection of a project’s
files and directories. So within this workspace, you’ll see the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>data</code> folder, containing a single data file (click on
it to see the data file within it).</li>
<li>Two files, a <code>climate_analysis.py</code> Python file, and a
<code>LICENSE.md</code> file</li>
</ul>
<p>So next, let’s look at editing code.</p>

<p>Now we’ve acquainted ourselves with running VSCode, let’s take a look
at our example code. Select the <code>climate_analysis.py</code> file in
the explorer window, which will bring up the contents of the file in the
code editor.</p>
<div id="the-file-explorer-has-disappeared" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="the-file-explorer-has-disappeared" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">The File Explorer has Disappeared!</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>You may find, perhaps on reopening VSCode, that the explorer is no
longer visible. In this case, you can select <code>Explorer</code> from
the sidebar to bring it back up again, and if you don’t currently have a
workspace loaded, you can select <code>Open Folder</code> to select the
code folder.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Note that as an example, it’s deliberately written to have flaws.
Things like the line spacing is inconsistent, there are no code
comments, there’s a variable that’s not used, and you may spot other
issues too. But in essence, the code is designed to do the
following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open a file in the CSV (comma separated value) format</li>
<li>Go through the file line by line, and:
<ul>
<li>If the line begins with a <code>#</code> symbol, ignore it.</li>
<li>Otherwise, extract the fourth column (which is in Fahrenheit),
convert it to Celsius and Kelvin, and output those readings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of what the code editor gives us.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="syntax-highlighting">Syntax Highlighting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#syntax-highlighting"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>You’ll notice that the Python syntax is being highlighted for us,
which helps readability.</p>
<p>FIXME: add screenshot of code editor with syntax highlighting of code
example</p>
<p>Here, it uses colour to distinguish the various parts of our program.
Functions are yellow, Python statements are purple, variables are light
blue, and strings are this reddy-orange, and so on. Which, perhaps
unsurprisingly, is a feature known as Syntax Highlighting, and it’s
possible to edit the colour scheme to your liking for a particular
language if you like, although we won’t go into that now.</p>
<p>This is really handy to give you immediate feedback on what you are
typing, and can help you to identify common syntax mistakes. For
example, deleting the closing parenthesis on <code>open</code> - the
opening one goes red, with a squiggly line underneath, indicating an
issue.</p>
<p>So this is great, and helps us understand what we are writing, and
highlights some mistakes.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="code-completion">Code Completion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#code-completion"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Something that’s also useful is VSCode’s ability (via the Python and
Pylance extensions) to help you write and format your code whilst you’re
typing.</p>
<p>For example, on a blank line somewhere, enter
<code>for x in something:</code>.</p>
<p>On the next line, we can see that it’s automatically indented it for
us, knowing that we’re inside a loop.</p>
<p>Another really helpful feature is something known as code completion
(in VSCode, this is referred to as IntelliSense). This is a great time
saver, and a really useful feature of IDEs. Essentially, as you type, it
works out the context of what you are doing, and gives you hints. For
example, if we start typing a variable we’ve already defined, for
example <code>climate_data</code>, we can see that it’s zeroing in as we
type on the options for what we might be trying to type. When we see
<code>climate_data</code>, we can press <code>Tab</code> to complete it
for us. As another example, if we wanted to open another file, we might
type <code>new_file = open(</code>. In this case, it provides
information on the file <code>open</code> function and its arguments,
along with a description of what it does. This is really handy to we
don’t have to take the time to look up all this information up on the
web, for example.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>FIXME: intro to code linter (add to intro section)</p>
<p>In the introduction we covered code linting tools, which go even
further that syntax highlighting to analyse and identify deeper issues
with our code. The good news is that we can install a Python linter in
VSCode to give us this code analysis functionality, by installing a
linter extension. As before, select the <code>Extensions</code> icon and
this time search for <code>Pylint</code>, the one by Microsoft, and
click <code>Install</code>.</p>
<div id="what-is-pylint" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="what-is-pylint" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">What is Pylint?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Pylint is a tool that can be run from the command line or via IDEs
like VSCode, which can help our code in many ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure consistent code style : whilst in-IDE context-sensitive
highlighting such as that provided by VSCode, it helps us stay
consistent with established code style standards such as (<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/" class="external-link">PEP 8</a>) as we write code by
highlighting infractions.</li>
<li>Perform basic error detection: Pylint can look for certain Python
type errors.</li>
<li>Check variable naming conventions: Pylint often goes beyond PEP 8 to
include other common conventions, such as naming variables outside of
functions in upper case.</li>
<li>Customisation: you can specify which errors and conventions you wish
to check for, and those you wish to ignore.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Going back to our code you should now find lots of squiggly
underlines of various colours.</p>
<div id="i-dont-see-any-squiggly-underlines" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="i-dont-see-any-squiggly-underlines" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">I don’t see any Squiggly Underlines!!</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>If you happen to not see any squiggly underlines in the editor, it
could be the linter extension hasn’t looked at your code yet. In order
to trigger the linter to show us further issues, try saving the file to
trigger the linter to do this. So go to <code>File</code> then
<code>Save</code> on the menu bar, and you should now see a lot of
squiggly underlines in the code.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>These squiggly lines indicate an issue, and by hovering over them, we
can see details of the issue. For example, by hovering over the
variables <code>shift</code> or <code>comment</code> - we can see that
the variable names don’t conform to what’s known as an
<code>UPPER_CASE</code> naming convention. Simply, the linter has
identified these variables as constants, and typically, these are in
upper case. We should rename them, e.g. <code>SHIFT</code> and
<code>COMMENT</code>. But following this, we also need to update the
reference to <code>comment</code> in the code so it’s also upper case.
Now if we save the file selecting <code>File</code> then
<code>Save</code>, we should see the linter rerun, and those highlighted
issues disappear.</p>
<p>We can also see a comprehensive list of all the issues found, by
opening a code <code>Problems</code> window. In the menu, go to
<code>View</code> then <code>Problems</code>, and then you’ll see a
complete list of issues which we can work on displayed in the pane at
the bottom of the code editor. We don’t have to address them, of course,
but by following them we bring our code style closer to a commonly
accepted and consistent form of Python.</p>
<p>The linter also picks up things like functions that don’t have
docstrings which we’ll take a look at. For now, we can close the
<code>Problems</code> pane.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="need-a-thing-install-an-extension">Need a Thing? Install an Extension!<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#need-a-thing-install-an-extension"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>As we just saw, included in the list of issues with our code was the
lack of docstrings. If we want to write good code, we should be adding
code comments, including docstrings for our functions, methods, and
modules.</p>
<p>Let’s try and find an extension that might help us with writing
docstrings. Select the <code>Extensions</code> icon, and type
<code>docstring</code> - you should see an <code>autoDocstring</code>
extension by Nils Werner at the top. Select that, and you’ll see a page
outlining what it is Also note via the number of downloads that it’s
very widely used.</p>
<p>What’s really handy is the little video that shows us what it does
This looks exactly like what we’re after! Select
<code>Install</code>.</p>
<p>Now, when we go to a function for example <code>FahrToCelsius</code>,
go to the next line, and add <code>“””</code>, we’ll see a small pop-up
to add a docstring. Press <code>Tab</code> to do so.</p>
<p>FIXME: add screenshot snippet showing docstring boilerplate being
added</p>
<p>It does all the hard work of adding in the structure of a docstring
for us, so we just need to fill in the blanks. This is another good
example of us realising it would be nice to have something to help us,
searching for an extension, and trying it out.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>For those of you familiar with version control and who retrieved the
example code via cloning its repository instead of downloading it, there
are some other editor features that help with using version control. One
of these is that the filename changes colours in the file explorer
depending on its status within version control:</p>
<ul>
<li>White - an existing file is unchanged from the copy in the local
repository).</li>
<li>Orange - the content of an existing file has changed, and the
change(s) have not been tracked by version control yet.</li>
<li>Green - a new file has been added and is unknown to version
control.</li>
</ul>
<p>So at a glance, you can get an idea of what’s changed since your last
commit.</p>

<p>So in summary, many of these editing features are typical of IDEs in
general, and the great thing is that they are really helpful at saving
us time. Things like syntax highlighting, code completion, automatic
code formatting and inserting docstrings, may not seem like much, but it
all adds up!</p>

<p>If you’re running an Anaconda distribution of Python on Windows, if

<p>VSCode has a sophisticated method to access it’s inner functionality
known as the Command Palette, which we’ll use to address this. Activate
the Command Paletter by pressing <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Shift</code>
+ <code>P</code> simultaneously, then type

<p>The pop-up window is known as the “Console”, and essentially is a

type <code>dir</code>, on Mac or Linux you could type <code>ls</code> -
to get a listing of files, for example.</p>
<p>We can also close this terminal/console at any time, and start a new
one by selecting <code>Terminal</code> from the menu and selecting

the option of never having to leave VSCode at all for most things.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="debugging-code">Debugging Code<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#debugging-code"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now finally, let’s look at a feature with IDEs which is often
overlooked, that of the debugger.</p>
<p>A debugger is a bit like performing exploratory surgery on a patient.
You know there’s something wrong, but you don’t know exactly where the
problem resides. What’s useful with debuggers is that you go looking
within the codebase as it’s actually running to find the source of the
problem.</p>
<p>In order to run a debugging session we first need to tell the IDE
where we’d like to examine the code. Then you run the code in a special
way, using a debugger, and it pauses the execution of the code at that
point. You then have the freedom to take a look around and examine the
state of variables, which functions have been called up until this
point, and so on, and hopefully identify the cause of the issue.</p>
<p>Now, many people when starting out with coding disregard debuggers as
complicated and tough to understand. And 30 or 40 years ago, debuggers
were indeed quite complicated to set up and use. But these days,
debuggers are perhaps a little more straightforward, with IDEs doing a
lot of complex stuff for us.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="introducing-a-problem">Introducing a Problem<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introducing-a-problem"></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s assume we have a problem with our code - by introducing one. In
our <code>climate_analysis.py</code> code, where it says
<code>if data[0][0] != COMMENT</code>, replace <code>COMMENT</code> with
<code>'!'</code>. We perhaps might assume one of our colleagues
erroneously made this change, but we haven’t spotted it yet. We try to
run the code as before, and now it doesn’t work. We get a
<code>ValueError</code>, which informs us it couldn’t perform a
conversion of a value extracted from the data file to a float as part of
its temperature conversion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="adding-a-debugging-breakpoint">Adding a Debugging Breakpoint<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#adding-a-debugging-breakpoint"></a>
</h3>
<p>Now we know where the error is occurring but we don’t know the source
of the problem, which may not be in the same place. So let’s add in what
is known as a <strong>breakpoint</strong> to our code. This is where the
debugger will stop running the code and pause for us Let’s add it at the
start of the <code>for line in climate_data:</code> line. We do that by
clicking in the left margin for that line. By hovering in the margin,
you’ll see a faded red dot appear. Select it on that line and this sets
the breakpoint.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="using-the-debugger">Using the Debugger<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-the-debugger"></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s run the code using the debugger. Select the
<code>Run and Debug</code> icon on the left, and select
<code>Run and Debug</code>. Then it will likely ask two questions in
pop-up pane near the top:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It asks you to <code>Select debugger</code>, so select the suggested
<code>Python Debugger</code>.</li>
<li>Then it asks you to <code>Select a debug configuration</code>, so
select <code>Python File</code> to debug the current file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the Python script is running in debug mode. You’ll see the
execution has paused on the line we entered the breakpoint, which is now
highlighted., Some new information is now displayed in various panes on
the left of the code editor. In particular:</p>
<p>FIXME: show screenshot of debugging panes (esp. variables and call
stack)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>VARIABLES</code> - on the left, we can see a list of
variables, and their current state, at this point in the script’s
execution, such as <code>COMMENT</code> and <code>SHIFT</code>, and
<code>climate_data</code> (which is a reference to our open data file).
We don’t have many at the moment. It also distinguishes between local
variables and global variables - this is to do with the “scope” of the
variables, as to how they are accessible from this point in the running
of the code. Global variables can be seen from anywhere in the script.
And local variables are those that are visible from this point of the
program. If we were within a function here, we would see variables that
are defined and only used within that function as local variables only.
For example, if we set a breakpoint within the <code>FahrToKelvin</code>
function, we would see <code>kelvin</code> as a local variable, but it
wouldn’t be listed as a global variable.</li>
<li>
<code>CALL STACK</code> - this is a record of the journey the script
has taken, in terms of functions called, to get to this position in its
execution. It shows us that we are at the top level of our script, which
makes sense, since our breakpoint is at the top level of script, and not
within any function. If it were within the <code>FahrToKelvin</code>
function, for example, we’d see that added to the call stack. It also
shows us the line number where execution has paused at this level of the
call stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we can also see some new icons at the top to do with
debugging:</p>
<p>FIXME: show screenshot snippet of debugging icons</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is continue, which allows the script to keep running
until the next breakpoint.</li>
<li>The next one allows us to step over - or through - the script one
statement at a time.</li>
<li>The next two allow us to choose to step into or out of a function
call, which is interesting. If we want to examine the inner workings of
a function during this debug session, we can do that.</li>
<li>The green cycle one is to restart the debug process.</li>
<li>The red cross stops debugging completely.</li>
</ul>
<p>So let’s step through our code by selecting the second icon and see
what happens. As we do so, we can see the variable state changing. By
looking in the variables section, we can see that the <code>line</code>
variable contains the first line read from the data file. On the next
step, we’ve reached the <code>if</code> statement. If we step again, and
then again, our program halts because it’s run into the problem we saw
before.</p>
<p>This tells us something useful - that the problem occurs in the first
iteration of the loop. So, this implies, the problem might be with the
first line of data being processed, since the Python is going through
the data file line by line. If we re-run the debugger, we can go through
this process again. And we can see something interesting when we get to
the <code>if</code> statement. From the code, we know that the if
statement is looking for an exclamation mark at the beginning of the
line to indicate a comment. However, the data variable contains a ‘#’ as
the first character instead. Therefore, in this case, the code will
assume it’s a data line and attempt to process it as such. And then it
will fail with the exception we saw before.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="fixing-the-issue">Fixing the Issue<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fixing-the-issue"></a>
</h3>
<p>So now we’ve identified the problem, we can fix it.</p>
<p>Firstly, stop the debug process by selecting the red square. Then
edit the <code>if</code> line to search for <code>COMMENT</code>
instead, reverting the code to what it was before. We can then rerun the
debugger if we wish, to check our understanding. And as we step through
the code, we can see if correctly identifies the first line as a
comment, and ignores it, continuing to the iteration of the for loop,
and the next line of data. Now we have our solution fixed, we can stop
the debugger again.</p>
<p>We’ve now solved our problem, so we should remove the breakpoint.
Running our code again as normal, we can see it now works as
expected.</p>
</div>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="debugging-in-context">Debugging in Context<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#debugging-in-context"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Typically, we’d use debugging when we’ve discovered a problem. Other
techniques, such as testing, are great at identifying that there
<strong>are</strong> problems, but not always the root cause and
location of the actual problem. Debugging is the next step of that
process. Sometimes, we discover a problem - perhaps our code testing
show us there’s an issue, or maybe we find out some other way. If we’re
lucky, we can identify and fix the problem quickly. Where we can’t,
debugging is there to help us. With particularly complex programs, it
can be very difficult to reason about how they work, and where the
problem are, and debugging allows us to pick apart that process, and
step by step, help us find the source of those issues.</p>

<p>Open a shell On own machine: open terminal with a bash shell Using
the shell, we’re going to use Git to clone our example GitHub code
repository The URL is bit long - see the session notes for a copy and
pastable link - it’s the second link at the top git clone <a href="https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/code-style-example" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/code-style-example</a></p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Next, let’s take a look at the code, which is in the root directory
of the repository So the example code here is designed to process
temperature data from a separate data file (which is also in the
repository in the data directory) The idea is that is reads in
fahrenheit data from a data file, and prints out fahrenheit temperatures
in both celsius and kelvin The data file is a CSV file (see
sc_climate_data_10.csv) which is held in the data directory It contains
a number of lines, each containing a number of values, each separated by
a comma There’s also a comment line at the top, to tell us what each
column represents Now let’s take a look at the Python code Use any
editor you like to open the file, I’ll use a command line one called
nano If you’re on a Mac or Linux, you should be able to use this too cd
code-style-example nano climate-analysis.py The code opens the data
file, defines some functions to do some conversions I should point out
that the code is deliberately written to be bad In so many ways we’ll
look into Developers sometimes talk about “code smells” Code smells are
cursory indications from looking at the source code that a piece of code
may have some deeper issues And looking at this code, it smells pretty
terrible We can see that there is inconsistent spacing, bunching in some
places, very spread out in others, for example This doesn’t engender a
great deal of confidence that the code will work as we expect It raises
the question that if the style of the code appears rushed, what else has
been rushed? It’s design? Testing? Something to bear in mind when
writing code!</p>
<p>QUESTION: who has seen or used code that looks like this? Yes/No?
QUESTION: who has written code like this? Yes/No</p>
<p>No one writes great code that’s readable, well formatted, and well
designed all the time Sometimes you often need to explore ideas with
code to understand how the code should be designed May involve trying
things out first But … the key is that once you understand how to do
something, it’s a good idea to make sure it’s readable and
understandable by others And this includes a future version of yourself,
6 months down the line So it’s really helpful to have good clean code so
your colleagues or development team can understand it So it can be
extended and otherwise modified in the future But it’s also a really
good idea if you write readable code for just yourself. You never know.
The code may be useful elsewhere! An all too familiar example is You
stop developing a piece of code, and put it to one side. Maybe it’s not
needed any more, perhaps a project has finished. You forget about it
BUT… suddenly, there’s a need to use the code again Maybe all of it in
another project, or maybe to just part of it You come back to your code,
and it’s a mess you can’t understand By spending a little time now to
write good code while you understand it, you can save yourself (and
possibly others) a lot of time later</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now despite the issues with the code, does it work? Let’s find out So
in the shell In the root directory of the repository, we can type python
climate_analysis.py And we can see that the code does indeed appear to
work, with celsius and kelvin values being printed to the terminal But
how can we improve its code formatting? Let’s use Pylint, a static
Python code analysis tool to help us</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The first thing we need to do is Install pylint Now fortunately,
pylint can be installed as a Python package QUESTION: who has installed
a Python package before, using the program pip? Yes/No QUESTION: who has
created and used a Python virtual environment before? Yes/No Ok, so
we’re going to create what’s known as a virtual environment This is a
genuinely very useful technique - I cannot recommend this strongly
enough! There isn’t a developer I know that doesn’t use virtual
environments to install their packages whenever they can And to be
honest, this could be a topic all on its own The idea is that Instead of
installing Python packages at the level of our machine’s Python
installation, which we could do We’re going to install them within their
own container, which is separate to the machine’s Python installation
And then we’ll run our Python code only using packages within that
virtual environment The benefit of this is that it creates a clear
separation between the packages we use for this project, and the
packages we use for another The other benefit is that we don’t end up
with a machine’s Python installation with a clutter of a thousand
different packages Can become very difficult to tell which packages are
used for which project If someone else needs to run your code for
example, by using a virtual environment, you can be sure what your code
actually needs as dependencies</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="setting-up-a-development-environment">Setting up a Development Environment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#setting-up-a-development-environment"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>So let’s create a Python virtual environment now, and activate it So,
make sure you’re in the root directory of the repository, then type
python -m venv venv Here, we’re using the built-on Python venv module -
short for virtual environment - to create a virtual environment
directory called venv We could have called the directory anything, but
naming it venv is a common convention We create the venv within the
repository root directory, which is also an established convention This
makes sure the venv is closely associated with this project, and not
easily confused with another Once created, we can activate the venv so
it’s the one in use We do that by: (if on Linux or Mac) source
venv/bin/activate (if on Windows) source venv/Scripts/activate QUESTION:
who has successfully created and activated their virtual environment?
Yes/No? Ok, so what’s in this virtual environment? we can do: pip list
We can see this is essentially empty, aside from some default packages
that are always installed So, the next thing we can do is install any
packages needed for this codebase It turns out, there isn’t any needed
for the code itself But - we wish to use pylint, and that’s a python
package So we can install pylint into our virtual environment using pip
install pylint You’ll notice the prompt changes to reflect that the
virtual environment is active - a handy reminder And with that, we’re
ready to go Important thing with virtual environments Don’t add the venv
directory to a GitHub repository</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now the magic can happen - let’s run pylint If you run it without any
arguments, we can see it’s got a daunting array of options But
fortunately the basic use is very simple Let’s point it at our code and
see what it thinks pylint climate_analysis.py We run this, and it gives
us a report essentially, a list of issues, and a score for each issue,
it tells us the filename, the line number and text column the problem
occurred, an issue identifier (what type of issue it is), and some text
describing this type of error (as well as a shortened form of the error
type) You’ll notice there’s also a score at the bottom, out of 10
Essentially, for every infraction, it deducts from the ideal score of 10
It is perfectly possible to get a negative score! It just keeps
deducting from 10! But we can see here that our score appears very low -
0.59/10 If we were to resolve each of these issues in turn, we should
get a perfect score We can also ask for more information on an error
type for example, we can see at line 9, near column 35, there is a
trailing whitespace pylint —help-msg C0303 Which is helpful if we need
clarification if we edit the file, e.g. nano climate-analysis.py and go
to line 9, column 35, (we can use nano’s cursor locator function to help
us find column 35), we can see that there is an unnecessary space I’ve
made this visible in nano so you can see it (although usually you
wouldn’t) QUESTION: who’s managed to run pylint on the example code?
Yes/No Let’s fix this issue now. Let’s remove the space and re-run
pylint on it Delete space, save pylint climate_analysis.py And we see
that the error has disappeared and our score has gone up! Note that it
also gives us a comparison against our last score Warning - it can get
quite addictive to keep increasing your score which might well be the
point! So looking at the issue types, what do the C, W, R symbols mean?
Show pylint —long-help At the end, we can see a breakdown of what they
mean I is for informational messages C for a programming standards
violation - it’s not conforming to the normally accepted conventions of
writing good code, things like variable or function naming R for a need
to refactor, due to a “bad code smell” W for warning - something that E
for error - so pylint think’s it’s spotted a bug (useful, but I wouldn’t
depend on this!) and F for a fatal pylint error So if we run it again on
our code pylint climate_analysis.py We can see that most of our issues
are do to with conventions</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We can also obtain a more verbose report, which gives us a lot more
detail pylint —reports y file QUESTION: for those doing activity, who’s
managed to run this command? YES/NO It gives you some overall
statistics, plus comparisons with the last time you ran it such as how
many modules, classes, methods and functions were looked at some raw
metrics - we’ll come back to that the extent of code duplication (none,
which is good) the number of messages by category (again, we can see
that it’s mainly convention issues) and a sorted count of the messages
we received now coming back to the raw metrics We can see that is breaks
down our program into how many lines are code lines, python docstrings
standalone comments and empty lines this is very useful, since it gives
us an idea of how well commented our code is in this case - not very
well commented at all! what’s a good % of comments to aim for? well it
depends for normal comments, the usually accepted wisdom is to add them
to explain why you are doing something, or perhaps to explain how
necessarily complex code works</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>QUESTION: Who’s familiar with Python docstrings? Yes/No for those
that don’t know, docstrings are a special kind of comment for a
function, that explain what the function does, the parameters it
expects, and what is returned you can also write docstrings for classes,
methods, and modules but you should usually aim to add docstring
comments to your code wherever you can, particularly for critical or
complex functions let’s add one to our code now, to the fahr_to_celsius
function</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>What doesn’t pylint - and other code analysis tools - give us? What
are their limitations? They don’t tell us that the code works - this
first and foremost And they don’t tell us if the results our code
produces are actually correct So we still need to test our code They
don’t give us any Idea of whether it’s a good implementation And that
the technical choices are good ones For example, this code does its own
temperature conversions It turns out there’s a number of well-maintained
Python packages that do this, e.g. pytemperature so we should be using a
tried and tested package instead of reinventing the wheel They also
don’t tell us if the implementation is actually fit for purpose Ok, so
the code is a good implementation, and it works as expected But is it
actually solving the intended problem? They also don’t tell us anything
about the data the program may use Which may have its own problems So we
have to be a bit careful These are all valid, high-level questions to
ask while you’re writing code I’ve added them to the google doc As a
team, and also individually In the fog of development, it can be
surprisingly easy to lose track of what’s actually being implemented</p>
<p>A good idea is to revisit these questions regularly, to be sure you
can answer them! A high score or zero warnings may give us false
confidence Just because we have reached a 10.00 score, doesn’t mean the
code is actually GOOD Just that it’s likely well formatted and hopefully
easier to read and understand But nevertheless, it’s a low effort way to
check our code And such tools are still very useful, as far as they
go</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Let’s first take a look at the example code on GitHub You’ll find the
code in the root of the repository you’ve just cloned cd git_example
Look at climate_analysis.py It’s designed to perform some temperature
conversions from fahrenheit to either celsius or kelvin The code is for
illustrative purposes If we actually wanted to do temperature
conversions, there are at least three existing Python packages we would
ideally use instead And with this code, there are a number of rather
large issues (which is deliberate!) The code is a little untidy -
inconsistent spacing and commenting, hardcoded file paths, not using a
library to handle the CSV data files, and others, such as… function
names are capitalised - perhaps we need to change these to be lower
case, and use underscores between words - a naming style also known as
snake case also, we’re missing some comments (known as docstrings)
describing the function and the script (or module) itself for those that
haven’t encountered docstrings yet, they are special comments described
in a particular format that describe what the function or module is
supposed to do you can see an example here - e.g. what it does, input
arguments, what it returns there’s also an incorrect function name
FahrToCels - which should be FahrToCelsius - this will cause it to fail
if I run it one thing to note on this repository is that we have a
single main branch used to be called a master branch, which you may see
in older repositories you’ll notice some commits on the main branch
already - one way to look at this is as a single “stream” of development
we’ve made changes to this codebase one after the other on this main
branch however, it might be that we may want to add a new software
feature, or fix a bug in our code and this may take, maybe, more than a
few commits to complete and make it work, perhaps over a matter of hours
or days of course, as we make changes to make this feature work, the
commits along the way may well break the “working” nature of our
repository and after that, users getting hold of our software by cloning
the repo, also get a version of the software that then isn’t working
this is also true for developers as well - it’s hard to develop, say, a
new feature for a piece of software, if you don’t start with software
that is working the problem would also become compounded if other
developers came on board, perhaps as part of a new project that will
develop the software what would be nice, would be to have our cake and
eat it, so to speak where we can change our code using version control
to track our changes, but not interfere with our working code on the
main branch and as we’ve heard from Jeremy, repository branches can give
us just that</p>

<p>Before we do that, let’s create a few new issues on our repository,
to represent some work we’re going to do in this session One thing that
might be good to do is to tidy up our code So let’s add issues to fix
that script function naming bug, changing our function names to use
snake case, and add the missing docstrings So go to your new repository
in GitHub in a browser, and select “Issues” Then select “New issue”, and
add something like the following In the title add: Functions should use
snake case naming style In summary I’ll add the following, but don’t
feel you need to! Naming of functions currently is using capitalisation,
and needs to follow snake case naming instead For the purposes of this
activity, let’s also assign ourselves, then select “Submit the issue”
Repeat for another two issues - although to save time, let’s only focus
on adding the issue title this time The googledoc has the list of titles
to use for each issue “Add missing docstrings to function and module”
“Script fails with undefined function name error” We’ll refer back to
these later! QUESTION: who’s created the three issues? Yes/No</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We’ll start by working on the missing docstring issue For the sake of
this activity, let’s assume that the bug which causes the script to fail
is being tackled by someone else</p>
<p>So let’s now create a feature branch (also known in some places as
“topic” branches), and work on adding that docstring, using that branch
Now on the command line, we’ve checked out our new repository, and can
see what branches it currently has by doing git branch (with no
arguments) And we can see we have only our main branch With an asterisk
to indicate it’s the current branch we’re on [[[ git branch -a Where
“-a” means show us all branches But also two “remotes/origin” branches -
which are references to the remote repository we have on GitHub In this
case, a reference to the equivalent “main” branch in the remote
repository HEAD here - as you may know - refers to the latest commit, so
this refers to the latest commit on the main branch (which is where we
are now) You can think of ”origin” as a stand-in for the full repository
URL Indeed, if we do “git remote -v”, we can see the full URL for
“origin” The first - remotes/origin/HEAD - refers to the latest commit
on the active branch on the remote repo The second - refers to the
branch itself]]] If we do “git log”, we can see only one commit so far
So, in order to get started on our docstring work, let’s tell git to
create a new branch by using “git branch” to create a branch this time
When we name the branch, it’s considered good practice to include the
issue number, and perhaps something useful about the issue, in the name
of the feature branch Makes it easier to see what this branch was about
git branch issue-2-missing-docstrings Now if we use “git branch, we can
see that our new branch has been created! Great! But - if we type “git
status”, we see that we’re still on our main branch, and any commits at
this point will still go on this main branch and not our new one
QUESTION: who’s created their new feature branch? Yes/No So what we need
to do is to switch to this new branch, which we can do via git checkout
issue-2-missing-docstrings Now if we do “bit branch” again, we can see
we’re on the new branch And if we do “git status”, we also see that
we’re on this new branch A very good habit to get into - use “git
status” before you do anything It helps to clarify on which branch
you’re working, and also any outstanding changes you may have forgotten
about! Now, one thing that’s important to realise, is that the contents
of the new branch are at the state at which we created the branch
something… If we do “git log”, to show us the commits, we can see they
are the same as when we first cloned the repository i.e. from the first
commit So any commits we do now, will be on our new feature branch and
will depart from this commit on the main branch and be separate from any
other commits that occur on the main branch</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now we’re on our feature branch, we can make some changes to fix this
issue So open up the climate_analysis.py file in an editor of your
choice For simplicity, I’m just going to use a command line editor
called nano I’m going to add the following to the FahrToKelvin
function</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb1">

</div>
<p>QUESTION: Who has added this to the file, and saved it? Yes/No</p>
<p>Now we’ve done this, let’s commit this change to the repository on
our new branch git add climate_analysis.py git commit -m “#2 Add missing
function docstring” Notice we’ve added in the issue number and a short
description to the commit message here If you’ve never seen this before,
this is considered good practice We’ve created an issue describing the
problem, and in the commit, we reference that issue number explicitly
Later, we’ll see GitHub will pick up on this, and in this issue, we’ll
be able to see the commits associated with this issue Now we’ve also got
a module docstring to add as well, so let’s add that Open up our editor
on this file again</p>
<p>““” Performs conversions between different temperature scales.”””</p>
<p>git add climate_analysis.py git commit -m “#2 Add missing module
docstring” So again, we’re committing this change against issue 2 Now
let’s look at our new branch git log So, as we can see, we now have our
initial commit (inherited from the main branch) and our two new commits
on this branch for our missing docstring)</p>
<p>QUESTION: who’s edited the file and made the changes, and committed
them - who’s done that twice? Yes/No</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now let’s push these changes to GitHub Since this is a new branch, we
need to tell GitHub where to push the new branch commits, by naming the
branch on the repository If we just type “git push” We get a suggestion
telling us so, which is quite helpful! git push –set-upstream origin
issue-2-missing-docstrings So here, we’re telling git to push the
changes on the new branch to a branch with the same name on the remote
repository ‘origin’ here is a shorthand that refers to the originating
repository (the one we cloned originally) You’ll notice a message
suggesting we could do a pull request to merge the changes with the main
branch QUESTION: who’s committed that change and pushed the new branch
with its commits to GItHub? Yes/no Let’s do this now!</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We’ve essentially fixed this issue now, so next we need to somehow
merge these changes on our feature branch with the main branch And we’ll
do that now by using a pull request Now before this, particularly if it
was code I was changing, I would normally have tested the changes and
ensured the code is working properly To save time, we haven’t done that
here, but that’s definitely something worth noting! Before pushing any
changes, test your code first If you have any unit tests, run those too
to check that your changes haven’t broken anything And also,
particularly if this was a change implementing a new feature, I’d
consider writing a new unit test to test that feature You may have been
present at our previous Research Software Camp session on code review,
where we used pull requests as a mechanism to review code changes across
a team We’ll be using a pull request here too But if you weren’t, a pull
request is a way to propose changes on a particular Git branch, and
request they be merged with another branch They’re really useful as a
tool in teams, since they provide a way to check the changes before
doing a merge They allow you to see the changes to files across all the
commits in the branch, and look at how these commits will change the
codebase And you can assign a number of reviewers to review the pull
request, and submit a review with their thoughts on whether to accept
the pull request, or make changes, and so on. Really useful! So we could
create the pull request on the command line, but we’ll use the GitHub
interface to do it Which frankly, is much clearer and gives you a far
better view of what’s going on! So let’s go back to our repository on
GitHub You may see a message about protecting the main branch We may
come back to this later, so no need to worry about this for now! If we
select the dropdown where it says “main”, it gives us a list of branches
We can see all branches by selecting that option at the bottom And now,
we can see we have our new branch that has appeared Which is separate
from our main branch If we select that, we can see the state of the
repository within this branch Including the new latest commits here - on
climate-analysis.py</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="create-a-pull-request">Create a Pull Request<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#create-a-pull-request"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Let’s create the pull request now, by selecting “Compare &amp; pull
request” We could also do this from “Pull requests” if we wanted, but
let’s take the offered option Now it shows us an interface for creating
the PR Importantly, at the top, it shows us which branch will be merged
with which branch With the source branch on the right, and the
destination branch on the left This should be our new branch for
compare, and main for base Also, it tells us we are “able to merge” -
and in this case, there are no conflicts to worry about, which is really
handy You may rightly ask “what do I do if there are conflicts?” - a
good question, and we’ll look at this later! Below this, it also shows
us the commits associated with this branch as well as the sum of changes
to the files by these commits We’ll rename the PR to reference issue 2
directly Changing it to “Fixes #2 - missing docstrings” We could add
more contextual information if needed And also assign reviewers, as we
did in the previous session on code review But for simplicity, we’ll
leave those for now But we will assign the PR to ourselves, since it’s a
good idea to assign responsibility where we can …and let’s create the
pull request QUESTION: who’s created the pull request? Yes/No</p>
<p>Now we get another screen describing the new PR itself If we’d
assigned any reviewers, we now wait for their reviews of this pull
request - and we could assume we’ve just done that, and the PR is good
Again, this is a major strength of using PRs, and I thoroughly recommend
it By PRs, and having reviews of PRs, it’s not just a number of people
making changes in isolation In collaborations around software, it’s so
important to increase the flow of information between people making
changes, in case there are any new potential issues that are introduced
And PRs give us that discipline - an opportunity really - to make sure
that the changes we are making are well considered And this becomes part
of the overall cycle of development We write code, we have it reviewed,
it gets merged But also, we help with reviewing other code too Again, it
tells us we can merge this branch automatically, and also the list of
commits involved Interestingly, even though we have created this PR to
do a merge, we could continue developing our code on this new branch
indefinitely if we wanted We could make and push new commits to this
branch, which would show up here And we could merge at a future date
This may be particularly useful if we need to have a longer discussion
about the PR as it is developing And the discussion could be captured in
the comments for the PR And when ready, we could then merge the PR Which
raises the question, of how long should PRs be open, or branches for
that matter To some degree, this depends on the nature of the changes
being made But branches in Git are designed, and should be wherever
possible, short-lived The longer a branch is open, the more potential
changes could be made to the main branch Then when it comes time to
merge the branch, we may get a lot of conflicts we need to manage So
generally, it’s a good idea to keep your branches open for a day or two,
a few days maximum, before creating a PR and doing a merge if you can
Note that we can also see this PR, as well as any others, by selecting
the “Pull request” tab</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>You’ll notice there’s a subtle dropdown on the “Merge pull request”
button And one other option we have is how to perform the merge You may
remember from the introduction about doing a “rebase and merge” as
opposed to just doing a merge commit Since it leads to a cleaner
repository history For example, if we did a normal merge here, we’d end
up with our two new commits and a merge commit But if we do a rebase and
then merge, our two commits are essentially just added to the top of
main Let’s do that - select the third option in the dropdown: “Rebase
and merge” Note that if there had been a conflict with any commits on
the main branch, we very likely wouldn’t have been able to merge using
this method Which in itself is a good question - even if we’d done a
straight commit, what would happen if there was a conflict? If we have
time, we’ll look at this later A question came up earlier about
disadvantages of using rebasing You can also do rebasing with branches
on the command line But a word of warning - when doing this, be really
sure you know what you’re doing Since rebasing in this way rewrites the
repository’s history And therefore, with rebasing, there is a GOLDEN
RULE Which states that you should only rebase with a local branch, never
a public (shared) branch you suspect is being used by others When
rebasing, you’re re-writing the history of commits If someone else has
the repository on their own machine and has worked on a particular
branch, say If you rebase on that branch, the history will have changed,
and they will run into difficulties due to the rewritten history It can
get quite messy! If in doubt, do a standard merge</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="merge-the-pull-request">Merge the Pull Request<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#merge-the-pull-request"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>So now let’s go ahead and “Rebase pull request” We can add more
information here if needed - but let’s “Confirm rebase and merge” Note
that it says that the merge was done successfully, and suggests we can
delete the branch QUESTION: who has merged the pull request? Yes/No We
said earlier that branches in Git should be short lived where possible,
and keeping branches hanging around may cause confusion So let’s delete
it now Now if we go the main branch on the main repository page in
GitHub, we can see that the changes have been merged And if we look at
“commits”, we can see the commits we made on our feature branch have
been added to the main branch</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="see-commits-on-issues">See Commits on Issues<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#see-commits-on-issues"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now, remember those commit messages with the issue numbers in them?
If we go to our issues, we can see them with the commits associated with
those issues They’re listed in chronological order Which is really handy
when checking on issue progress Plus, it means the reason behind each
commit is now traceable back to the originating issue So why are there
two sets of commits, when we only made one? That’s because we first made
two commits to the branch And then, using a rebase method, we applied
our commits to the main branch</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="summary">Summary<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#summary"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>So what are the benefits so far? By using different feature branches,
as opposed to just committing directly to the main branch, we’ve
isolated the “churn” of developing a feature from the main branch So
this really is a key benefit - it allows us to maintain a working main
branch It also gives us the opportunity to abandon a branch entirely,
with no need to manually change things back In such a case, all we need
to do is delete the branch Another benefit is in the other direction We
are also effectively isolated from the changes being made on other
feature branches So when a number of changes are being made, we still
(hopefully!) only have to worry about our own changes And it also gives
us a process that helps us maintain a working version on main for our
users (which may very well include ourselves!) And it also gives us a
mechanism - via pull requests - to have others review our code before
changes are introduced into the codebase</p>
<p>So what we’ve shown is one way to use feature branch workflow Using
feature branches directly off the main branch, and merging to main We’ve
chosen this way for the training, since it’s more straightforward to
teach in a practical activity But there are others Another way is to use
a long-lived branch off of main, called usually something like “dev” or
“develop” And this dev branch would represent a general branch of
development And using this approach, feature branches are created off of
the dev branch instead, and then merged back to the dev branch And
later, when a release of the software is due, or at an appropriate
point, the dev branch is merged with the main branch This gives
development greater distance from the main branch, which could be a good
thing And it means you can merge and test all changes together on that
branch before you merge with the main branch, to ensure it all works
together But also means when it comes to merge, it can be more difficult
since the dev branch could have built up a considerable number of
changes that need to be merged In either case, the key is to make sure
that code is tested and checked with the right people in your team
before you merge to main</p>

<p>Now we have two other issues we can look at And these are interesting
- both of them require changes that can cause a conflict when merging
Let’s look at those now First, let’s go to main and pull the repository
changes on the main branch to our local repository Always a good idea to
do this! use git pull to synchronise your local repo with the GitHub one
git checkout main git pull git log So now, again, we have those two
commits on main as we would expect Let’s create a feature branch to fix
our snake-case issue git branch issue-1-use-snake-case git checkout
issue-1-use-snake-case So now, edit the climate_analysis.py file, and
change functions to use a snake case style e.g. FahrToCelsius to
fahr_to_celsius Remember to change the one in the fahr_to_kelvin
function! Note we’ve changed the call to fahrtocelsius near the bottom
let’s commit this to our new feature branch git add climate_analysis.py

<p>At this point, we could follow this advice and merge this branch’s
work into the main branch This would be very neat and tidy! But life is
rarely like that - and what happens when someone else commits their
changes in some way to the main branch? Where does that leave us when we
come to merge? Let’s find out! You may recall we created an issue for
fixing the function call to the FahrToCelsius function - the call
referenced the function incorrectly. The function name was wrong Let’s
assume that a colleague has made these changes, and updated the main
branch Hopefully they’ve done this on a feature branch and merged it,
but maybe not! Let’s pretend we’re our colleague, and we’re making this
fix to the main branch First, let’s switch to the main branch git
checkout main git status git log Now as we can see, this main branch is
completely unaware of the commits in our new feature branch And is at
the initial state of the repository Let’s make the fix Now we could (and
should) create a feature branch here, make and commit the change, then
merge with the main branch But for the sake of time, let’s just commit
directly to the main branch, and assume they did it the right way Edit
the climate_analysis.py file And update the “FahrToCels” function call
to “FahrToCelsius”, and save the changes git status git add
climate_analysis.py git commit -m “#3 Fix incorrect function call” git
log git push Now - we have this extra commit on main Which we can see if
we do git log</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now let’s see what happens when we create a pull request on our
feature branch, as before, and try to merge Again, let’s go to GitHub
and this time, go to “Pull requests”, select “New pull request” And
select the new feature branch issue-1-use-snake-case Then select it in
“compare”, and ensure that “base” says “main” now - note that is says we
can’t automatically merge! It’s handy that it does this - it’s compared
the source and destination branches, and determined that there is a
conflict Since there are different edits on the same line for commits in
the main and feature branch But we’ll go ahead and create the PR anyway
- select “Create pull request” title: Fixes #1 - use snake case naming
assign yourself create pull request We create the PR, and we see “This
branch has conflicts that must be resolved” And in this case, there is
only one conflicting file - climate_analysis.py - but there could be
more than one Now we can attempt to resolve the conflict by selecting
“resolve conflicts” QUESTION: who’s resolved conflicts during a merge on
the command line? Yes/No It can be a bit tricky, yes? The GitHub
interface for doing this is quite a bit nicer! It tells you which files
have the conflicts on the left (only climate_analysis.py in this case)
And where in each file the conflicts are So let’s fix the conflict Near
the bottom, we can see that our snake case naming of that function call
conflicts with the fix to it And this has caused a conflict Now
importantly we have to decide how to resolve the conflict If we’re
lucky, common sense can help us! Now our snake_case fix resolves this
issue anyway, since we’re calling the function correctly, which makes
the other fix redundant So let’s remove the other fix We do this by
editing out the chevron and equals parts, and the fix we don’t want We
then select “Mark as resolved”, then “commit merge” Now unfortunately,
due to the conflict commit, we can no longer rebase and merge So select
the option to create a merge commit Then select merge pull request, and
confirm merge And as before, delete the feature branch</p>

<p>if we go to the repository’s list of commits now (in the main branch)
we see that we have a “merge branch main into issue-1-use-snake-case”
commit which resolves the conflict (which occurred on the feature
branch) and also a merge pull request commit, for when we merged the
feature branch with main</p>
