<p>Let’s start by running VSCode now on our machines, so run it now. How
you run VSCode will differ depending on which operating system you have
installed.</p>
<p>TODO: add screenshot of opening vscode for first time</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll likely see is a “Welcome” page. You may find
it asks you which kind of theme you’d like - you can select from either
a dark or light theme.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="navigating-around-vscode">Navigating Around VSCode<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#navigating-around-vscode"></a>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>So let’s take a look at the application. You’ll see some icons on the
left side, which give you access to its key features. Hovering your
mouse over each one will show a tooltip that names that feature:</p>
<p>TODO: add screenshot with highlighted icons for what we’ll cover
here</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Explorer</code> - the top one is a file navigator, or
explorer - we can use this to open existing folders containing program
files.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Search</code> - the next one down is a search capability,
so you can search for things (and replace them with other text) over
your code files.</p></li>
<li>
<p><code>Source control</code> - this gives you access to source
code control, which includes Git version control functionality. This
feature means you can do things like clone Git repositories (for
example, from GitHub), add and commit files to a repository, things like
that.</p>
<div id="callout1" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Callout</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>If you’re not familiar with Git, that’s totally fine - you don’t have
to use this feature, although it’s worth looking into using version
control for writing your code. Version control Systems like Git allow
you to manage your code by storing it - and all the changes you make to
it - within a repository hosted elsewhere, for example, on GitHub.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p><code>Run and Debug</code> - this allows you to run programs you
write in a special way with a debugger, which allows you to check the
state of your program as it is running, which is very useful and we’ll
look into later.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Extensions</code> - which we’ll look into right now, allows
you to install extensions to VSCode to extend its functionality in some
way.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other features and ways to access them, and we’ll
cover key ones throughout this lesson.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="installing-extensions">Installing Extensions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#installing-extensions"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Extensions are a major strength of VSCode. Whilst VSCode appears
quite lightweight, and presents a simple interface (particularly
compared to many other IDEs!), this is quite deceptive. You can extend
its functionality in many different ways. For example, installing
support for other languages, greater support for version control,
there’s even support for working with databases, and so on. There are
literally tens of thousands of possible extensions now.</p>
<p>Now VSCode already comes with built-in support for JavaScript,
including TypeScript and node.js, but also has extensions for other
languages too (C++, C#, Java, PHP, Go, and many others). Installing a
language extension will allow you to do more things with that particular
language in VSCode, as we’ll see later.</p>
<p>Let’s install an extension now:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Firstly, select the extensions icon first, then type in Python into
the search box at the top, and it’ll give you a list of all
python-related extensions.</li>
<li>Select the one which says <code>Python, IntelliSense ...</code> from
Microsoft. This is the Microsoft official Python extension.</li>
<li>Then select <code>Install</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>It might take a minute - you can see a sliding blue line in the top
left to indicate it’s working. Once complete, you should see a couple of
“Welcome” windows introducing you to two of its key features - support
for Python and Jupyter notebooks. If you use Jupyter notebooks, which is
a way of writing Python programs that you can run line by line from
within an editor as you write the program, you may find this useful.</p>
<p>For now, let’s configure this extension for our Python development,
and to do that, we need to do is tell VSCode which Python installation
on our machine we’d like it to use. In the Python Welcome window, select
<code>Select a Python interpreter</code>, and then
<code>Select Python interpreter</code>. You may find you have many
installations of Python, or only have one. Try to select one later than
3.8 if you can. Then select <code>Mark done</code>, and close the
welcome windows.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="editing-code">Editing Code<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#editing-code"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>FIXME: copy code-style-example to softwaresaved’s organisation</p>
<p>Next, let’s obtain some example Python code and edit it from within
VSCode. So first, you can download the example code we’ll use from <a href="https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/code-style-example/releases/tag/v1.0.0" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/code-style-example/releases/tag/v1.0.0</a>,
either as a <code>.zip</code> or <code>.tar.gz</code> compressed archive
file. If you’re unsure, download the <code>.zip</code> file. Then,
extract all the files from the archive into a convenient location. You
should see files contained within a new directory named
<code>code-style-example-1.0.0</code>.</p>
<p>Now we need to load the code into VSCode to see it. You can do this
in a couple of ways, either:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Select the <code>Source control</code> icon from the middle of the
icons on the left navigation bar. You should see an
<code>Open Folder</code> option, so select that.</li>
<li>Select the <code>File</code> option from the top menu bar, and
select <code>Open Folder...</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In either case, you should then be able to use the file browser to
locate the directory with the files you just extracted, and then select
<code>Open</code>. Note that we’re looking for the <em>folder</em> that
contains the files, not a specific file.</p>
<div id="what-about-using-git-version-control" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="what-about-using-git-version-control" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">What about using Git Version Control?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>If your system has the Git version control system installed, you may
see a <code>Clone Repository</code> option here too. If you are familiar
with Git and wish to use this option, select this option instead and
enter the repository’s location as
<code>https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/code-style-example</code>. Then
use the file browser that is presented to find a convenient location to
store the cloned code and click on
<code>Select as Repository Destination</code>, then select
<code>Open</code> when ‘Would you like to open the cloned repository?’
appears.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>You’ll then likely be presented with a window asking whether you
trust the authors of this code. In general, it’s a good idea to be at
least a little wary, since you’re obtaining code from the internet, so
be sure to check your sources! Be careful here - I found on Windows the
“Trust” option appears on the left, whilst on Mac, it appears on the
right! In this case, feel free to trust the repository! You’ll then see
the explorer present you with some files in a small window (or pane) on
the left you can use to navigate and find files.</p>
<p>So far within VSCode we have downloaded some code from a repository
and opened a folder. Whenever we open a folder in VSCode, this is
referred to as a “Workspace” - essentially, a collection of a project’s
files and directories. So within this workspace, you’ll see the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>data</code> folder, containing a single data file (click on
it to see the data file within it).</li>
<li>Two files, a <code>climate_analysis.py</code> Python file, and a
<code>LICENSE.md</code> file</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s select the climate_analysis.py file, which will bring up the
contents of the file in the code editor.</p>

<p>Now we’ve acquainted ourselves with running VSCode, let’s take a look
at our example code. Note that as an example, it’s deliberately written
to have flaws. Things like the line spacing is inconsistent, there are
no code comments, there’s a variable that’s not used, and you may spot
other issues too. But in essence, the code is designed to do the
following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open a file in the CSV (comma separated value) format</li>
<li>Go through the file line by line, and:
<ul>
<li>If the line begins with a <code>#</code> symbol, ignore it.</li>
<li>Otherwise, extract the fourth column (which is in Fahrenheit),
convert it to Celsius and Kelvin, and output those readings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of what the code editor gives us. You’ll
notice that the Python syntax is being highlighted for us, which helps
readability Here, it uses colour to distinguish the various parts of our
program functions are yellow, Python statements are purple, variables
are light blue, and strings are this reddy-orange, and so on Which,
perhaps unsurprisingly, is a feature known as Syntax Highlighting, and
it’s possible to edit the colour scheme to your liking for a particular
language if you like, although we won’t go into that now This is really
handy to give you immediate feedback on what you are typing, and can
help you to identify common syntax mistakes for example, deleting the
closing parenthesis on ‘open’ - the opening one goes red, with a
squiggly line underneath, indicating an issue So this is great, and
helps us understand what we are writing, and highlights some mistakes.
But we can take it further If you were here for the last Byte-sized RSE
session, you may remember we looked at using what’s known as a code
linter tool to check our code for deeper issues, and suggest common
conventions to make our code more readable The good news is that we can
install a Python linter in VSCode to give us similar functionality, by
installing a linter extension So let’s go to extensions, and search for
“pylint”, the one by microsoft, and click install</p>
<p>Now, let’s go back to our code You may find lots of squiggly
underlines But if you don’t, in order to trigger the linter to show us
further issues, I usually find saving a file triggers the linter to
examine our code So go to File -&gt; Save on the menu bar, and you
should see a lot of squiggly underlines in our code These squiggly lines
indicate an issue - by hovering over them, we can see details of the
issue For example, by hovering over “shift” or “comment” - we can see
that the variable names don’t conform to what’s known as an UPPER_CASE
naming convention Simply, the linter has identified these variables as
constants, and typically, these are in upper case. We should rename them
like this [demo] But we also need to update the reference to lower case
comment in the code [demo] Now if we save the file (File -&gt; Save), we
should see the linter rerun, and those issues disappear We can also see
a comprehensive list of all the issues found, by opening a Problems
window In the menu, go to View -&gt; Problems, then you’ll see a
complete list of issues which we can work on We don’t have to, of
course, but by following them we bring our code style closer to a
commonly accepted form of Python It also picks up things like functions
missing docstrings - we’ll look at this later For now, we can close the
Problems window Something that’s also useful is VSCode’s ability to help
you format your code whilst you’re typing For example, “for x in
something:” [show indentation] On the next line, we can see that it’s
automatically indented it for us, knowing that we’re inside a loop
[Delete for added loop] Another really helpful feature is something
known as code completion (in VSCode, this is referred to as
IntelliSense) This is a great time saver, and a really useful feature of
IDEs Essentially, as you type, it works out the context of what you are
doing, and gives you hints For example, if we start typing a variable
we’ve already defined, for example “climate_data”, we can see that it’s
zeroing in as we type on the options for what we might be after. When we
see “climate_data”, we can press “Tab” to complete it for us As another
example, if I wanted to open another file: “new_file = open(“ - it
provides information on the “open” command and its arguments, along with
a description of what it does [scroll down] So, we don’t have to take
the time to look all this information up on the web, for example
Autodocstring Something we noted earlier, in the list of issues with our
code, was the lack of docstrings If we want to write good code, we
should be adding code comments, including docstrings for our functions,
methods, and modules Well, it sure would be nice if there was something
to add in docstrings for us. Let’s try and find an extension that might
help us Select the extensions icon, and type “docstring” - you should
see “autodocstring” at the top Select that, and you’ll see a page
outlining what it is Also note it’s very widely used - 4.6M downloads
What’s really handy is the little video that shows us what it does This
looks exactly like what we’re after! Select install Now, when we go to a
function for example, go to the next line, and add “””, we’ll see a
small pop-up to add a docstring - press Tab to do so It does all the
hard work of adding in the structure of a docstring for us, so we just
need to fill in the blanks This is another good example of us realising
it would be nice to have something to help us, searching for an
extension, and trying it out If we bring up the explorer sidebar, we can
see an Outline of our code, which helps us to navigate around larger
code files quickly, by double clicking on the items And for those of you
familiar with version control, there are some other editor features that
help with this One of these is that the filename changes colours in the
file explorer white (means the file is unchanged from the copy in the
local repository), orange (means its changed), or if it’s red, it
indicates that there’s a code problem somewhere There’s also the
timeline, which shows you a history of what’s happened to this workspace
In terms of commits to it within the repository, in this case, only an
initial commit of our files, and also some local changes as we’ve saved
the file</p>
<p>So in summary, many of these editing features are typical of IDEs in
general The great thing is that they are helpful at saving us time
Things like syntax highlighting, code completion, automatic code
formatting and inserting docstrings, may not seem like much, but it all
adds up As you get more familiar with these features, writing code just
becomes quicker and more pleasant</p>

<p>Now let’s try running a Python file First, make sure your Python
doesn’t have any errors! Then, select the “Play”-looking icon at the top
You should see the program run, and output displayed in a pop-up window
at the bottom QUESTION: did you see the program output in the window at
the bottom? yes/no IF NO: if you’re on Windows, and installed anaconda,
did you get an error message saying “the term conda is not recognised”?
yes/no [problem: is that VSCode is not looking in the right place for
anaconda’s installation. Fix: Command Palette (Ctrl/Shift P) -&gt;
Terminal: Select Default Profile, select Command Prompt C:…] QUESTION:
if you encountered this error, does this fix it? yes/no This
pop-window/terminal is known as the “Console”, and essentially is a
terminal, or command prompt, where the program is run You’ll notice we
can also type in commands here too. e.g. in Windows, you could type
“dir”, on mac or Linux you could type “ls” - to get a listing of files,
for example This is all great so far The really nice thing, is that for
many things, when we write and run our code, we never have to leave
VSCode at all, which I find really efficient Now finally, let’s look at
a feature with IDEs which is often overlooked, that of the debugger A
debugger is a bit like performing exploratory surgery on a patient You
know there’s something wrong, but you don’t know exactly where So you go
looking within the codebase as it’s running to find the source of the
problem, then fix it So how it works, is that you essentially tell the
IDE where you’d like to examine the code Then you run the code in a
special way, using a debugger And it pauses the running at that point
You then you can take a look around and examine the state of variables,
which functions have been called up until this point, and so on And
hopefully, you’ll spot the cause Now, many people when starting out with
coding, me included, disregarded debuggers as complicated and tough to
understand And 30 or 40 years ago, debuggers were indeed quite
complicated to set up and use But these days, debuggers are at least a
little more straightforward, with IDEs doing a lot of complex stuff for
us, which is great So let’s try out debugging on this code Let’s assume
we have a problem with our code - by introducing a problem! Where it
says “if data[0][0] != COMMENT”, replace COMMENT with ‘!’ We perhaps
might assume one of our colleagues erroneously made this change, but we
haven’t spotted it We try to run the code, and lo and behold, it doesn’t
work We get a ValueError - where it couldn’t perform a conversion of a
value extracted from the data file to a float (as part of its
temperature conversion) So ok, now we know where the error is occurring,
but we don’t know the source of the problem, which not be in the same
place - but somewhere before So let’s add in what is known as a
“breakpoint” to our code This is where the debugger will stop running
the code and pause for us Let’s add it at the start of the “for line in
climate_data:” line We do that by clicking in the left margin for that
line By hovering in the margin, you’ll see a faded red dot appear,
select it on that line This sets the breakpoint Now, let’s run the code
using the debugger Select the ‘Run and debug’ icon on the left, and
select ‘Run and debug’ You’ll likely see a pop-up appear asking about
“Debug Configuration” Select the one “Python File”, perhaps near the top
Now the Python script is running in debug mode You’ll see the execution
has paused on this line (which is now highlighted), and some new
information is displayed On the left, we can see a list of variables,
and their current state, at this point in the script’s execution Such as
comment and shift, and climate_data (which is a reference to our open
data file). We don’t have many at the moment It also distinguishes
between local variables and global variables - this is to do with the
“scope” of the variables, as to how they are accessible from this point
in the running of the code Global variables can be seen from anywhere in
the script And local variables are those that are visible from this
point of the program If we were within a function here, we would see
variables that are defined and only used within that function as local
variables only for example, if we set a breakpoint within the
FahrToKelvin function, we would see “kelvin” as a local variable, but it
wouldn’t be listed as a global variable We can also see a call stack,
which is a record of the journey the script has taken, in terms of
functions called, to get to this position It shows us that we are at the
top level of our script Which makes sense, since our breakpoint is at
the top level of script And not within any function. If it were within
the FahrToKelvin function, for example, we’d see that added to the call
stack Now, we can also see some new icons at the top to do with
debugging The first one, is continue - it allows the script to keep
running until the next breakpoint The next one allows us to step over -
or through - the script one statement at a time The next two allow us to
choose to step into or out of a function call, which is interesting. If
we want to examine the inner workings of a function during this debug
session, we can do that The green cycle one is to restart the debug
process And the red cross stops debugging completely So let’s step
through our code, and see what happens As we do so, we can see the
variable state changing We can now see that the line variable contains
the first line read from the data file By looking in the variables
section On the next step, we’ve reached the if statement If we step
again, and then again, our program halts because it’s run into the
problem we saw before Now this tells us something It tells us that the
problem occurs in the first iteration of the loop So, this implies, the
problem might be with the first line of data being processed If we
re-run the debugger, by selecting the green cycle, we can do it again
And we can see something interesting when we get to the if statement We
know that the if statement is looking for an exclamation mark at the
beginning of the line to indicate a comment However, the data variable
contains a ‘#’ as the first character instead So in this case, the code
will assume it’s a data line and attempt to process it as such And then
it will fail with the exception we saw before So - we’ve identified the
problem! Now let’s fix it Firstly, stop the debug process by selecting
the red square Then edit the if line to search for ‘COMMENT’ instead We
can then rerun the debugger if we wish, to check our understanding And
as we step through the code, we can see if correctly identifies the
first line as a comment, and ignores it, continuing to the iteration of
the for loop, and the next line of data [Stop the debugger] We’ve now
solved our problem, so we should remove the breakpoint Running our code
again as normal, we can see it seems to work. Problem fixed! So
debugging code is a useful feature And let’s set it in context with
other practices of software development Typically, we’d use debugging
when we’ve discovered a problem Those of you who attended the Byte-sized
RSE session on testing, may remember we looked at using unit testing to
check our programs behaved as we intended i’ve put a link to a guide
that introduces unit testing into the googledoc if you’re interested and
looks at the kinds of things we looked at in that session By writing
test cases as bits of code to check functions produced results with
certain inputs This was great at helping us discover the presence of
problems with our code But only told us there was a problem - it doesn’t
tell us where Well, debugging is the next step of that process
Sometimes, we discover a problem - perhaps our unit tests show us
there’s an issue Or maybe we find out some other way If we’re lucky, we
can identify and fix the problem quickly Where we can’t, debugging is
there to help us With particularly complex programs, it can be very
difficult to reason about how they work, and where the problem are
Debugging allows us to pick apart that process, and step by step, help
us find the source of those issues</p>
