<p>This session provides an introduction to Integrated Development
Environments (IDEs), powerful tools for software development. We will
explore how various features built into IDEs can streamline your
software development workflow, especially through their built-in
debugging tools — which allow you to identify and fix issues with your
code efficiently.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="what-is-an-integrated-development-environment-ide">What is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-an-integrated-development-environment-ide"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a graphical
application that provides a comprehensive workspace for writing,
editing, testing, and debugging code—all in one place. At the core of an
IDE is a code editor, and it combines several tools that developers need
into a single interface to streamline the code development process. IDEs
are extremely useful and modern software development would be very hard
without them.</p>
<p>Historically, developers typically wrote code using simple text
editors, often terminal-based with no graphical interface or syntax
checking support. They had to rely on separate tools outside the editor
to compile, debug, and manage their code, making development a much more
fragmented experience. It is worth noting that popular terminal-based
editors such as Emacs and Vim may appear deceptively simple at first
glance - but they are, in fact, highly powerful and customisable
frameworks for coding and automating development workflows.</p>
<p>Today, although some IDEs are designed for specific programming
languages, many modern IDEs can support multiple languages through a
wide variety of plugins — often created and maintained by the developer
community.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="why-use-an-ide">Why use an IDE?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-use-an-ide"></a>
</h3>
<p>An IDE brings everything you need to write, test, and debug code into
one place — saving time by helping you write better code faster. IDEs
help by:</p>
<ul>
<li>reducing setup and development time - everything you need for
editing, running, and debugging code is in one place and the need to
switch between different tools/applications/windows is significantly
reduced</li>
<li>offering helpful tools like syntax checking, code suggestions and
autocomplete, and error checking leading to fewer errors thanks to
real-time feedback and intelligent suggestions</li>
<li>making it easier to debug and test code leading to easier issue
detection and fixing</li>
<li>providing a consistent environment across projects</li>
</ul>
<p>For beginners, IDEs lower the barrier to entry by making it easier to
spot mistakes and understand code structure. For experienced developers,
IDEs boost productivity and streamline complex workflows.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="common-ide-features">Common IDE Features<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#common-ide-features"></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s look at what most IDEs offer - these features all work together
to make your life easier when coding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code editor with syntax highlighting and automatic code formatting
for better readability and consistency</li>
<li>Intelligent code completion that suggests syntactically correct
options as you type to speed up development</li>
<li>Powerful search tools to quickly locate functions, classes, or
variables</li>
<li>Inline documentation and reference lookup to understand symbol
(functions, parameters, classes, fields, and methods) and variables
definitions and usage without leaving your code</li>
<li>Built-in support for running and managing tests through integrated
testing frameworks</li>
<li>Seamless integration with version control systems (like Git) for
tracking changes and collaboration</li>
<li>Debugging tools for setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and
inspecting variables during runtime</li>
<li>An integrated terminal for executing commands directly within the
IDE</li>
<li>A project/file explorer for easy navigation and management of your
software project</li>
</ul>
<p>Some IDEs also offfer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deployment tools to package and release your code efficiently</li>
<li>Basic project and issue tracking features to support task
management</li>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now, what happens when your code does not work as expected? That is
where code debugging comes in. Debugging means finding, understanding,
and fixing errors in your code — which can manifest as unexpected
behavior, crashes, or incorrect outputs. Debugging is an essential step
in software development, ensuring that your code runs as intended and
meets its requirements (and quality standards).</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="why-debugging-matters">Why Debugging Matters?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-debugging-matters"></a>
</h3>
<p>Debuggin ensures your code behaves as it should and helps you find
the root cause of problems — not just guess - when it does not. Even
small mistakes in code can cause unexpected behavior or crashes.
Debugging helps with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>code correctness</strong> - to ensure your program works as
expected and meets requirements</li>
<li>
<strong>error resolution</strong> - to help you understand why your
code is not performing correctly, allowing you to find and fix issues
that make your program behave incorrectly</li>
<li>
<strong>improving code quality</strong> - regular debugging leads to
cleaner, more reliable and performant code and reduces the risk of
problems in production</li>
<li>
<strong>efficient code development</strong> - familiarity with
debugging tools and techniques can significantly reduce the time spent
on troubleshooting and enhance overall productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Debugging is a normal part of the code development process - it is
not just about fixing mistakes — it is about understanding your code
better.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="common-debugging-techniques">Common Debugging Techniques<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#common-debugging-techniques"></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s be real — everyone’s code breaks sometimes. Debugging is just
part of the game. For starters, you can try <strong>rubber duck
debugging</strong> - a technique where you explain your code, line by
line, out loud — to a colleague or to an inanimate object like a rubber
duck. The idea is that by forcing yourself to verbalise what your code
is supposed to do, you slow down and think more clearly about each part,
which often helps you spot mistakes or logical errors you might have
missed when just reading the code silently.</p>
<p>In addition to talking to a rubber duck (which is surprisingly
effective), one of the simplest tricks is <strong>adding print
statements to your code</strong>: just printing out variable values or
messages at key points can quickly show you where things start to go
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Logging</strong> is another smart move, especially for bigger
projects, because it helps you track what your program is doing over
time and help diagnose issues that occur in specific runtime conditions.
A variant of logging is to use <strong>assert statements</strong> in
your code -</p>
<p>But if you want to level up, using a <strong>built-in
debugger</strong> (like the one in VS Code) is a game-changer — you can
set breakpoints, step through your code line by line, and actually see
what is happening in real time.</p>
<p>And if you really want to catch problems early, <strong>writing
tests</strong> to check that your code behaves properly can save you
from bigger headaches later.</p>

<p>Let’s start by running VSCode now on our machines, so run it now. How
you run VSCode will differ depending on which operating system you have
installed.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll likely see is a welcome-style page with links
to features for opening files, and creating or opening a project. You
may find it asks you which kind of theme you’d like - you can select
from either a dark or light theme.</p>

<p>So let’s take a look at the application. You’ll see some icons on the
left side, which give you access to its key features. Hovering your
mouse over each one will show a tooltip that names that feature:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/vscode-overview.png" class="image-with-shadow figure mx-auto d-block" style="width:100.0%" alt="Screenshot of VSCode interface"></figure><ul>
<li><p><code>Explorer</code> - the top one is a file navigator, or
explorer - we can use this to open existing folders containing program
files.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Search</code> - the next one down is a search capability,
so you can search for things (and replace them with other text) over
your code files.</p></li>
<li>
<p><code>Source control</code> - this gives you access to source
code control, which includes Git version control functionality. This
feature means you can do things like clone Git repositories (for
example, from GitHub), add and commit files to a repository, things like
that.</p>
<div id="callout1" class="callout">

<h3 class="callout-title">Callout</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>If you’re not familiar with Git, that’s totally fine - you don’t have
to use this feature, although it’s worth looking into using version
control for writing your code. Version control Systems like Git allow
you to manage your code by storing it - and all the changes you make to
it - within a repository hosted elsewhere, for example, on GitHub.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p><code>Run and Debug</code> - this allows you to run programs you
write in a special way with a debugger, which allows you to check the
state of your program as it is running, which is very useful and we’ll
look into later.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Extensions</code> - which we’ll look into right now, allows
you to install extensions to VSCode to extend its functionality in some
way.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other features and ways to access them, and we’ll
cover key ones throughout this lesson.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="installing-extensions">Installing Extensions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#installing-extensions"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Extensions are a major strength of VSCode. Whilst VSCode appears
quite lightweight, and presents a simple interface (particularly
compared to many other IDEs!), this is quite deceptive. You can extend
its functionality in many different ways. or example, installing support
for other languages, greater support for version control, there’s even
support for working with databases, and so on. There are literally tens
of thousands of possible extensions now.</p>
<p>Now VSCode already comes with built-in support for JavaScript,
including TypeScript and node.js, but also has extensions for other
languages too (C++, C#, Java, PHP, Go, and many others). Installing a
language extension will allow you to do more things with that particular
language in VSCode, as we’ll see now.</p>
<p>Let’s install an extension now:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Firstly, select the extensions icon first, then type in Python into
the search box at the top, and it’ll give you a list of all
python-related extensions.</li>
<li>Select the one which says <code>Python</code> from Microsoft. This
is the Microsoft official Python extension.</li>
<li>Then select <code>Install</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>It might take a minute - you can see a sliding blue line in the top
left to indicate it’s working. Once complete, you should see a couple of
“Welcome” windows introducing you to two of its key features - support
for Python and Jupyter notebooks. If you use Jupyter notebooks, which is
a way of writing Python programs that you can run line by line from
within an editor as you write the program, you may find this useful.</p>
<p>For now, let’s configure this extension for our Python development,
and to do that, we need to do is tell VSCode which Python installation
on our machine we’d like it to use. In the Python Welcome window, select
<code>Select a Python interpreter</code>, and then
<code>Select Python interpreter</code>. You may find you have many
installations of Python, or only have one. Try to select one later than
3.8 if you can. Then select <code>Mark done</code>, and close the
welcome windows.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="a-sample-project">A Sample Project<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-sample-project"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>FIXME: copy code-style-example repo to softwaresaved’s
organisation</p>
<p>Next, let’s obtain some example Python and edit it from within
VSCode. So first, you can download the example code we’ll use from <a href="https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/code-style-example/releases/tag/v1.0.0" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/code-style-example/releases/tag/v1.0.0</a>,
either as a <code>.zip</code> or <code>.tar.gz</code> compressed archive
file. If you’re unsure, download the <code>.zip</code> file. Then,
extract all the files from the archive into a convenient location. You
should see files contained within a new directory named
<code>code-style-example-1.0.0</code>.</p>
<p>Now we need to load the code into VSCode to see it. You can do this
in a couple of ways, either:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Select the <code>Source control</code> icon from the middle of the
icons on the left navigation bar. You should see an
<code>Open Folder</code> option, so select that.</li>
<li>Select the <code>File</code> option from the top menu bar, and
select <code>Open Folder...</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In either case, you should then be able to use the file browser to
locate the directory with the files you just extracted, and then select
<code>Open</code>. Note that we’re looking for the <em>folder</em> that
contains the files, not a specific file.</p>
<div id="what-about-using-git-version-control" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="what-about-using-git-version-control" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">What about using Git Version Control?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>If your system has the Git version control system installed, you may
see a <code>Clone Repository</code> option here too. If you are familiar
with Git and wish to use this option instead, select this option instead
and enter the repository’s location as
<code>https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/code-style-example</code>. Then
use the file browser that is presented to find a convenient location to
store the cloned code and click on
<code>Select as Repository Destination</code>, then select
<code>Open</code> when ‘Would you like to open the cloned repository?’
appears.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>You’ll then likely be presented with a window asking whether you
trust the authors of this code. In general, it’s a good idea to be at
least a little wary, since you’re obtaining code from the internet, so
be sure to check your sources! Be careful here - I found on Windows the
“Trust” option appears on the left, whilst on Mac, it appears on the
right! In this case, feel free to trust the repository! You’ll then see
the explorer present you with some files in a small window (or pane) on
the left you can use to navigate and find files.</p>
<p>So far within VSCode we have downloaded some code from a repository
and opened a folder. Whenever we open a folder in VSCode, this is
referred to as a “Workspace” - essentially, a collection of a project’s
files and directories. So within this workspace, you’ll see the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>data</code> folder, containing a single data file (click on
it to see the data file within it).</li>
<li>Two files, a <code>climate_analysis.py</code> Python file, and a
<code>LICENSE.md</code> file</li>
</ul>
<p>So next, let’s look at editing code.</p>

<p>Now we’ve acquainted ourselves with running VSCode, let’s take a look
at our example code. Select the <code>climate_analysis.py</code> file in
the explorer window, which will bring up the contents of the file in the
code editor.</p>

<div id="the-file-explorer-has-disappeared" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">The File Explorer has Disappeared!</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>You may find, perhaps on reopening VSCode, that the explorer is no
longer visible. In this case, you can select <code>Explorer</code> from
the sidebar to bring it back up again, and if you don’t currently have a
workspace loaded, you can select <code>Open Folder</code> to select the
code folder.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Note that as an example, it’s deliberately written to have flaws.
Things like the line spacing is inconsistent, there are no code
comments, there’s a variable that’s not used, and you may spot other
issues too. But in essence, the code is designed to do the
following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open a file in the CSV (comma separated value) format</li>
<li>Go through the file line by line, and:
<ul>
<li>If the line begins with a <code>#</code> symbol, ignore it.</li>
<li>Otherwise, extract the fourth column (which is in Fahrenheit),
convert it to Celsius and Kelvin, and output those readings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of what the code editor gives us.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="syntax-highlighting">Syntax Highlighting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#syntax-highlighting"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>You’ll notice that the Python syntax is being highlighted for us,
which helps readability.</p>
<p>FIXME: add screenshot of code editor with syntax highlighting of code
example</p>
<p>Here, it uses colour to distinguish the various parts of our program.
Functions are yellow, Python statements are purple, variables are light
blue, and strings are this reddy-orange, and so on. Which, perhaps
unsurprisingly, is a feature known as Syntax Highlighting, and it’s
possible to edit the colour scheme to your liking for a particular
language if you like, although we won’t go into that now.</p>
<p>This is really handy to give you immediate feedback on what you are
typing, and can help you to identify common syntax mistakes. For
example, deleting the closing parenthesis on <code>open</code> - the
opening one goes red, with a squiggly line underneath, indicating an
issue.</p>
<p>So this is great, and helps us understand what we are writing, and
highlights some mistakes.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="code-completion">Code Completion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#code-completion"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Something that’s also useful is VSCode’s ability (via the Python and
Pylance extensions) to help you write and format your code whilst you’re
typing.</p>
<p>For example, on a blank line somewhere, enter
<code>for x in something:</code>.</p>
<p>On the next line, we can see that it’s automatically indented it for
us, knowing that we’re inside a loop.</p>
<p>Another really helpful feature is something known as code completion
(in VSCode, this is referred to as IntelliSense). This is a great time
saver, and a really useful feature of IDEs. Essentially, as you type, it
works out the context of what you are doing, and gives you hints. For
example, if we start typing a variable we’ve already defined, for
example <code>climate_data</code>, we can see that it’s zeroing in as we
type on the options for what we might be trying to type. When we see
<code>climate_data</code>, we can press <code>Tab</code> to complete it
for us. As another example, if we wanted to open another file, we might
type <code>new_file = open(</code>. In this case, it provides
information on the file <code>open</code> function and its arguments,
along with a description of what it does. This is really handy to we
don’t have to take the time to look up all this information up on the
web, for example.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="code-linting">Code Linting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#code-linting"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>FIXME: intro to code linter (add to intro section)</p>
<p>In the introduction we covered code linting tools, which go even
further that syntax highlighting to analyse and identify deeper issues
with our code. The good news is that we can install a Python linter in
VSCode to give us this code analysis functionality, by installing a
linter extension. As before, select the <code>Extensions</code> icon and
this time search for <code>Pylint</code>, the one by Microsoft, and
click <code>Install</code>.</p>
<div id="what-is-pylint" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="what-is-pylint" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">What is Pylint?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Pylint is a tool that can be run from the command line or via IDEs
like VSCode, which can help our code in many ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure consistent code style : whilst in-IDE context-sensitive
highlighting such as that provided by VSCode, it helps us stay
consistent with established code style standards such as (<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/" class="external-link">PEP 8</a>) as we write code by
highlighting infractions.</li>
<li>Perform basic error detection: Pylint can look for certain Python
type errors.</li>
<li>Check variable naming conventions: Pylint often goes beyond PEP 8 to
include other common conventions, such as naming variables outside of
functions in upper case.</li>
<li>Customisation: you can specify which errors and conventions you wish
to check for, and those you wish to ignore.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Going back to our code you should now find lots of squiggly
underlines of various colours.</p>
<div id="i-dont-see-any-squiggly-underlines" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="i-dont-see-any-squiggly-underlines" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">I don’t see any Squiggly Underlines!!</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>If you happen to not see any squiggly underlines in the editor, it
could be the linter extension hasn’t looked at your code yet. In order
to trigger the linter to show us further issues, try saving the file to
trigger the linter to do this. So go to <code>File</code> then
<code>Save</code> on the menu bar, and you should now see a lot of
squiggly underlines in the code.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>These squiggly lines indicate an issue, and by hovering over them, we
can see details of the issue. For example, by hovering over the
variables <code>shift</code> or <code>comment</code> - we can see that
the variable names don’t conform to what’s known as an
<code>UPPER_CASE</code> naming convention. Simply, the linter has
identified these variables as constants, and typically, these are in
upper case. We should rename them, e.g. <code>SHIFT</code> and
<code>COMMENT</code>. But following this, we also need to update the
reference to <code>comment</code> in the code so it’s also upper case.
Now if we save the file selecting <code>File</code> then
<code>Save</code>, we should see the linter rerun, and those highlighted
issues disappear.</p>
<p>We can also see a comprehensive list of all the issues found, by
opening a code <code>Problems</code> window. In the menu, go to
<code>View</code> then <code>Problems</code>, and then you’ll see a
complete list of issues which we can work on displayed in the pane at
the bottom of the code editor. We don’t have to address them, of course,
but by following them we bring our code style closer to a commonly
accepted and consistent form of Python.</p>
<p>The linter also picks up things like functions that don’t have
docstrings which we’ll take a look at. For now, we can close the
<code>Problems</code> pane.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="need-a-thing-install-an-extension">Need a Thing? Install an Extension!<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#need-a-thing-install-an-extension"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>As we just saw, included in the list of issues with our code was the
lack of docstrings. If we want to write good code, we should be adding
code comments, including docstrings for our functions, methods, and
modules.</p>
<p>Let’s try and find an extension that might help us with writing
docstrings. Select the <code>Extensions</code> icon, and type
<code>docstring</code> - you should see an <code>autoDocstring</code>
extension by Nils Werner at the top. Select that, and you’ll see a page
outlining what it is Also note via the number of downloads that it’s
very widely used.</p>
<p>What’s really handy is the little video that shows us what it does
This looks exactly like what we’re after! Select
<code>Install</code>.</p>
<p>Now, when we go to a function for example <code>FahrToCelsius</code>,
go to the next line, and add <code>"""</code>, we’ll see a small pop-up
to add a docstring. Press <code>Tab</code> to do so.</p>
<p>FIXME: add screenshot snippet showing docstring boilerplate being
added</p>
<p>It does all the hard work of adding in the structure of a docstring
for us, so we just need to fill in the blanks. This is another good
example of us realising it would be nice to have something to help us,
searching for an extension, and trying it out.</p>

depending on its status within version control:</p>
<ul>
<li>White - an existing file is unchanged from the copy in the local
repository).</li>
<li>Orange - the content of an existing file has changed, and the
change(s) have not been tracked by version control yet.</li>
<li>Green - a new file has been added and is unknown to version
control.</li>
</ul>
<p>So at a glance, you can get an idea of what’s changed since your last
commit.</p>

<p>So in summary, many of these editing features are typical of IDEs in
general, and the great thing is that they are really helpful at saving
us time. Things like syntax highlighting, code completion, automatic
code formatting and inserting docstrings, may not seem like much, but it
all adds up!</p>

<p>If you’re running an Anaconda distribution of Python on Windows, if

<p>VSCode has a sophisticated method to access it’s inner functionality
known as the Command Palette, which we’ll use to address this. Activate
the Command Paletter by pressing <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Shift</code>
+ <code>P</code> simultaneously, then type

<code>Command Prompt C:\WINDOWS\...</code>, and hopefully that should

<p>The pop-up window is known as the “Console”, and essentially is a

type <code>dir</code>, on Mac or Linux you could type <code>ls</code> -
to get a listing of files, for example.</p>
<p>We can also close this terminal/console at any time, and start a new
one by selecting <code>Terminal</code> from the menu and selecting
<code>New Terminal</code>. So when we write and run our code, we have
the option of never having to leave VSCode at all for most things.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="debugging-code">Debugging Code<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#debugging-code"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now finally, let’s look at a feature with IDEs which is often
overlooked, that of the debugger.</p>
<p>A debugger is a bit like performing exploratory surgery on a patient.
You know there’s something wrong, but you don’t know exactly where the
problem resides. What’s useful with debuggers is that you go looking
within the codebase as it’s actually running to find the source of the
problem.</p>
<p>In order to run a debugging session we first need to tell the IDE
where we’d like to examine the code. Then you run the code in a special
way, using a debugger, and it pauses the execution of the code at that
point. You then have the freedom to take a look around and examine the
state of variables, which functions have been called up until this
point, and so on, and hopefully identify the cause of the issue.</p>
<p>Now, many people when starting out with coding disregard debuggers as
complicated and tough to understand. And 30 or 40 years ago, debuggers
were indeed quite complicated to set up and use. But these days,
debuggers are perhaps a little more straightforward, with IDEs doing a
lot of complex stuff for us.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="introducing-a-problem">Introducing a Problem<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introducing-a-problem"></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s assume we have a problem with our code - by introducing one. In
our <code>climate_analysis.py</code> code, where it says
<code>if data[0][0] != COMMENT</code>, replace <code>COMMENT</code> with
<code>'!'</code>. We perhaps might assume one of our colleagues
erroneously made this change, but we haven’t spotted it yet. We try to
run the code as before, and now it doesn’t work. We get a
<code>ValueError</code>, which informs us it couldn’t perform a
conversion of a value extracted from the data file to a float as part of
its temperature conversion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="adding-a-debugging-breakpoint">Adding a Debugging Breakpoint<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#adding-a-debugging-breakpoint"></a>
</h3>
<p>Now we know where the error is occurring but we don’t know the source
of the problem, which may not be in the same place. So let’s add in what
is known as a <strong>breakpoint</strong> to our code. This is where the
debugger will stop running the code and pause for us Let’s add it at the
start of the <code>for line in climate_data:</code> line. We do that by
clicking in the left margin for that line. By hovering in the margin,
you’ll see a faded red dot appear. Select it on that line and this sets
the breakpoint.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="using-the-debugger">Using the Debugger<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-the-debugger"></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s run the code using the debugger. Select the
<code>Run and Debug</code> icon on the left, and select
<code>Run and Debug</code>. Then it will likely ask two questions in
pop-up pane near the top:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It asks you to <code>Select debugger</code>, so select the suggested
<code>Python Debugger</code>.</li>
<li>Then it asks you to <code>Select a debug configuration</code>, so
select <code>Python File</code> to debug the current file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the Python script is running in debug mode. You’ll see the
execution has paused on the line we entered the breakpoint, which is now
highlighted., Some new information is now displayed in various panes on
the left of the code editor. In particular:</p>
<p>FIXME: show screenshot of debugging panes (esp. variables and call
stack)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>VARIABLES</code> - on the left, we can see a list of
variables, and their current state, at this point in the script’s
execution, such as <code>COMMENT</code> and <code>SHIFT</code>, and
<code>climate_data</code> (which is a reference to our open data file).
We don’t have many at the moment. It also distinguishes between local
variables and global variables - this is to do with the “scope” of the
variables, as to how they are accessible from this point in the running
of the code. Global variables can be seen from anywhere in the script.
And local variables are those that are visible from this point of the
program. If we were within a function here, we would see variables that
are defined and only used within that function as local variables only.
For example, if we set a breakpoint within the <code>FahrToKelvin</code>
function, we would see <code>kelvin</code> as a local variable, but it
wouldn’t be listed as a global variable.</li>
<li>
<code>CALL STACK</code> - this is a record of the journey the script
has taken, in terms of functions called, to get to this position in its
execution. It shows us that we are at the top level of our script, which
makes sense, since our breakpoint is at the top level of script, and not
within any function. If it were within the <code>FahrToKelvin</code>
function, for example, we’d see that added to the call stack. It also
shows us the line number where execution has paused at this level of the
call stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we can also see some new icons at the top to do with
debugging:</p>
<p>FIXME: show screenshot snippet of debugging icons</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is continue, which allows the script to keep running
until the next breakpoint.</li>
<li>The next one allows us to step over - or through - the script one
statement at a time.</li>
<li>The next two allow us to choose to step into or out of a function
call, which is interesting. If we want to examine the inner workings of
a function during this debug session, we can do that.</li>
<li>The green cycle one is to restart the debug process.</li>
<li>The red cross stops debugging completely.</li>
</ul>
<p>So let’s step through our code by selecting the second icon and see
what happens. As we do so, we can see the variable state changing. By
looking in the variables section, we can see that the <code>line</code>
variable contains the first line read from the data file. On the next
step, we’ve reached the <code>if</code> statement. If we step again, and
then again, our program halts because it’s run into the problem we saw
before.</p>
<p>This tells us something useful - that the problem occurs in the first
iteration of the loop. So, this implies, the problem might be with the
first line of data being processed, since the Python is going through
the data file line by line. If we re-run the debugger, we can go through
this process again. And we can see something interesting when we get to
the <code>if</code> statement. From the code, we know that the if
statement is looking for an exclamation mark at the beginning of the
line to indicate a comment. However, the data variable contains a ‘#’ as
the first character instead. Therefore, in this case, the code will
assume it’s a data line and attempt to process it as such. And then it
will fail with the exception we saw before.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="fixing-the-issue">Fixing the Issue<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fixing-the-issue"></a>
</h3>
<p>So now we’ve identified the problem, we can fix it.</p>
<p>Firstly, stop the debug process by selecting the red square. Then
edit the <code>if</code> line to search for <code>COMMENT</code>
instead, reverting the code to what it was before. We can then rerun the
debugger if we wish, to check our understanding. And as we step through
the code, we can see if correctly identifies the first line as a
comment, and ignores it, continuing to the iteration of the for loop,
and the next line of data. Now we have our solution fixed, we can stop
the debugger again.</p>
<p>We’ve now solved our problem, so we should remove the breakpoint.
Running our code again as normal, we can see it now works as
expected.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Typically, we’d use debugging when we’ve discovered a problem. Other
techniques, such as testing, are great at identifying that there
<strong>are</strong> problems, but not always the root cause and
location of the actual problem. Debugging is the next step of that
process. Sometimes, we discover a problem - perhaps our code testing
show us there’s an issue, or maybe we find out some other way. If we’re
lucky, we can identify and fix the problem quickly. Where we can’t,
debugging is there to help us. With particularly complex programs, it
can be very difficult to reason about how they work, and where the
problem are, and debugging allows us to pick apart that process, and
step by step, help us find the source of those issues.</p>

following a defined style guide improves code readability and
collaboration, and how automated tools, known as linters, can help
identify and fix style issues early in the development process. We will
explore common linting tools and how to integrate them into your
software development workflow.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="why-does-code-style-matter">Why Does Code Style Matter?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-does-code-style-matter"></a>
</h3>
<p>Software development is inherently a collaborative activity. Even if
you do not currently intend for anyone else to read your code, chances
are someone will need to in the future — and that person might even be
you, months or years later. By following and consistently applying code
styling guidelines, you can significantly improve the readability and
maintainability of your code. Consistency plays a vital role in this
process. Adopting a clear set of style guidelines not only helps you
write uniform code but also makes it easier to switch between projects.
This is especially important when working as part of a team, where
shared understanding and clarity are essential.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="key-code-style-practices-conventions">Key Code Style Practices &amp; Conventions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#key-code-style-practices-conventions"></a>
</h3>
<p>Styling practices and conventions play a key role in writing readable
and maintainable code, but they can vary significantly between
programming languages. These conventions generally cover aspects such as
line length, line splitting, the use of white space, naming conventions
for variables, functions, and classes, as well as indentation and
commenting styles (where not enforced by the language itself).</p>
<p>It is important to note that programmers often have strong and
differing opinions about what constitutes good style. For example, many
style guides recommend a maximum line length of 80 characters, a
convention that dates back to older hardware and terminal limitations.
While some developers continue to find this helpful for readability and
side-by-side editing, others argue that it feels unnecessarily
restrictive on modern screens. Despite these differences, adopting and
adhering to a consistent style within a project helps ensure clarity and
makes collaboration smoother.</p>
<p>There are many established code style guides tailored to specific
programming languages, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/" class="external-link">PEP8</a> and <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html" class="external-link">Google Style

<h3 id="maintaining-code-quality-to-reduce-bugs">Maintaining Code Quality to Reduce Bugs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#maintaining-code-quality-to-reduce-bugs"></a>
</h3>
<p>Poor coding style can lead to bugs and maintenance issues because it
makes code harder to read, understand, and debug. Inconsistent naming,
unclear structure, and sloppy formatting can cause confusion about what
the code is doing, making it easier to introduce mistakes. Many things
that seem harmless and do not cause immediate syntax errors while
writing code can produce logic errors, wrong results and lead to issues
later on - making them especially tricky to detect and fix. Small issues
like unused variables, accidental redefinitions, or incorrect scoping
can go unnoticed and later cause unexpected behavior or subtle logic
errors. Over time, this makes the codebase more fragile, harder to
maintain, and much more difficult for others — or even your future self
— to fix or extend.</p>
<p>Some examples of small oversights that stack up over time
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>defining variables or importing modules or headers that that are
never used can clutter the code</li>
<li>using vague variable names like <code>data</code> everywhere can
make it unclear which <code>data</code> you are actually handling,
causing mistakes</li>
<li>bad indentation can cause logic errors — like running a block of
code when you did not intend to</li>
<li>variable scoping problems (e.g. reusing the same variable name in
different scopes can lead to <em>shadowing</em>, where a local variable
hides a global or outer-scope variable, resulting in unexpected values
being used.</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<p>A linter is a tool that performs static analysis on your code —
meaning it examines the source code without running it — to detect
potential errors, stylistic issues, and code patterns that might cause
bugs in the future. The term originates from a 1970s tool for the C
programming language called “lint”.</p>
<p>Linters help catch errors early and enforce consistent code style,
making your code more reliable, readable, and easier to maintain. They
are especially useful for improving code quality and streamlining
collaboration in teams.</p>
</div>

<p>For example, in Python:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/" class="external-link"><code>flake8</code></a>
checks code for compliance with PEP8</li>
<li>
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pylint/" class="external-link"><code>pylint</code></a>
performs style checking along with additional linting
functionalities</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" class="external-link"><code>bandit</code></a>
focuses on static analysis to detect potential security
vulnerabilities.</li>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In the rest of this session, we will walk you through how to use a
linting tool.</p>
<p>The use of linting tools is often automated through integration with
Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines or pre-commit hooks available in
version controlled code repositories, helping to streamline the
development process and ensure code quality consistently on each commit.
This is covered in a separate session.</p>

open a Bash shell (via Git Bash in Windows or Terminal on a Mac). Then,
on the command line, navigate to where you’d like the example code to

<p>The code is designed to process temperature data from a separate data

out fahrenheit temperatures in both celsius and kelvin.</p>
<p>The code expects to find the data file

this:</p>

<p>It contains a number of lines, each containing a number of values,
each separated by a comma. There’s also a comment line at the top, to
tell us what each column represents.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the Python code, using any text or code
editor you like to open the file. You can also use <code>nano</code> if
you’d prefer to use the command line, e.g.</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb4">

<p>The code opens the data file, and also defines some functions to do
two temperature conversions from Fahrenheit to Celsius and Fahrenheit to
Kelvin. Note that for the purposes of this lesson, the code is
deliberately written to contain some issues!</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>QUESTION: who has seen or used code that looks like this? Yes/No?
QUESTION: who has written code like this? Yes/No</p>
<p>No one writes great code that’s readable, well formatted, and well
designed all the time. Sometimes you often need to explore ideas with
code to understand how the code should be designed, and this typically
involves trying things out first. But… the key is that once you
understand how to do something, it’s a good idea to make sure it’s
readable and understandable by other people, which may includes a future
version of yourself, 6 months into the future. So it’s really helpful to
end up with good clean code so yit’s easier to understand.</p>
<p>Another key benefit to writing “cleaner” code is that its generally
easier to extend and otherwise modify in the future. When code is
initially written it’s often impossible to tell if it will be reused in
some way elsewhere. A familiar scenario is that you stop developing a
piece of code for a while, and put it to one side. Maybe it’s not needed
any more, or perhaps a project has finished. You forget about it, until
suddenly, there’s a need to use the code again. Maybe all of it needs to
be reused in another project, or maybe just a part of it. However, you
come back to your code, and it’s a mess you can’t understand. But by
spending a little time now to write good code <em>while you understand
it</em>, you can save yourself (and possibly others) a lot of time
later!</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Developers sometimes talk about “code smells”. Code smells are
cursory indications from looking at the source code that a piece of code
may have some deeper issues. And looking at this code, it smells pretty
terrible. For example, we can see that there is inconsistent spacing,
with lines bunched together in some places, and very spread out in
others. This doesn’t engender a great deal of confidence that the code
will work as we expect, and it raises the question that if the style of
the code appears rushed, what else has been rushed? How about the design
of the code? Something to bear in mind when writing code!</p>

<p>Now despite the issues with the code, does it work? Let’s find out.
So in the shell, in the root directory of the repository:</p>

<p>And we can see that the code does indeed appear to work, with celsius
and kelvin values being printed to the terminal. But how can we improve
its readability? We’ll use a special tool, called a code linter, to help
us identify these sorts of issues with the code.</p>

<p>The first thing we need to do is install pylint, a very well
established tool for statically analysing Python code.</p>
<p>Now fortunately, pylint can be installed as a Python package, and
we’re going to create what’s known as a virtual environment to hold this
installation of pylint.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="benefits-of-virtual-environments">Benefits of Virtual Environments<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#benefits-of-virtual-environments"></a>
</h3>
<p>Virtual environments are an indispensible tool for managing package
dependencies across multiple projects, and could be a whole topic
itself. In the case of Python, the idea is that instead of installing
Python packages at the level of our machine’s Python installation, which
we could do, we’re going to install them within their own “container”,
which is separate to the machine’s Python installation. Then we’ll run
our Python code only using packages within that virtual environment.</p>
<p>There are a number of key benefits to using virtual environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>It creates a clear separation between the packages we use for this
project, and the packages we use other projects.</li>
<li>We don’t end up with a machine’s Python installation containing a
clutter of a thousand different packages, where determining which
packages are used for which project often becomes very time consuming
and prone to error.</li>
<li>Since we are sure what our code actually needs as dependencies, it
becomes much easier for someone else (which could be a future version of
ourselves) to know what these dependencies are and install them to use
our code.</li>
<li>Virtual environments are not limited to Python; for example there
are similar tools for available for Ruby, Java and JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="setting-up-a-virtual-environment">Setting up a Virtual Environment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#setting-up-a-virtual-environment"></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s now create a Python virtual environment and make use of it.
Make sure you’re in the root directory of the repository, then type</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb1">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

</div>
<p>Here, we’re using the built-on Python venv module - short for virtual
environment - to create a virtual environment directory called
<code>venv</code>. We could have called the directory anything, but
naming it <code>venv</code> (or <code>.venv</code>) is a common
convention, as is creating it within the repository root directory. This
makes sure the virtual environment is closely associated with this
project, and not easily confused with another.</p>
<p>Once created, we can <em>activate</em> it so it’s the one in use:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb2">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode bash" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">[Linux]</span> source venv/bin/activate</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">[Mac]</span> source venv/bin/activate</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">[Windows]</span> source venv/Scripts/activate</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>You should notice the prompt changes to reflect that the virtual
environment is active, which is a handy reminder. For example:</p>
<div class="codewrapper">
<h3 class="code-label">OUTPUT<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="output" tabindex="0"><code>(venv) $</code></pre>
</div>
<p>QUESTION: who has successfully created and activated their virtual
environment? Yes/No?</p>
<p>Now it’s created, let’s take a look at what’s in this virtual
environment at this point.</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb4">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

</div>
<p>We can see this is essentially empty, aside from some default
packages that are always installed. Note that whilst within this virtual
environment, we no longer have access to any globally installed Python
packages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="installing-pylint-into-our-virtual-environment">Installing Pylint into our Virtual Environment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#installing-pylint-into-our-virtual-environment"></a>
</h3>
<p>The next thing we can do is install any packages needed for this
codebase. As it turns out, there isn’t any needed for the code itself,
but we wish to use pylint, and that’s a python package. So we can
install pylint into our virtual environment:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb6">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

<p>You’ll notice there’s also a score at the bottom, out of 10.
Essentially, for every infraction, it deducts from an ideal score of 10.
Note that it is perfectly possible to get a negative score, since it
just keeps deducting from 10! But we can see here that our score appears
very low - 0.59/10, and if we were to now resolve each of these issues
in turn, we should get a perfect score.</p>

<p>And we see that the <code>C0303</code> issue has disappeared and our
score has gone up! Note that it also gives us a comparison against our
last score.</p>
<p>As a gentle warning: it can get quite addictive to keep increasing
your score, which might well be the point!</p>
<p>So looking at the issue identifiers, e.g. <code>C0303</code>, what do
the <code>C</code>, <code>W</code>, <code>R</code> prefix symbols
mean?</p>

</div>
<p>At the end, we can see a breakdown of what they mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>I</code> is for informational messages</li>
<li>
<code>C</code> is for a programming standards violation. Part of the
code is not conforming to the normally accepted conventions of writing
good code (e.g. things like variable or function naming)</li>
<li>
<code>R</code> for a need to refactor, due to a “bad code
smell”</li>
<li>
<code>W</code> for warning - something that</li>
<li>
<code>E</code> for error - so pylint think’s it’s spotted a bug
(useful, but don’t depend on this to find errors!)</li>
<li>
<code>F</code> for a fatal pylint error</li>
</ul>

<p>QUESTION: for those doing activity, who’s managed to run this
command? YES/NO</p>
<p>It gives you some overall statistics, plus comparisons with the last
time you ran it, on aspects such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many modules, classes, methods and functions were looked at</li>
<li>Raw metrics (which we’ll look at in a minute)</li>
<li>Extent of code duplication (none, which is good)</li>
<li>Number of messages by category (again, we can see that it’s mainly
convention issues)</li>
<li>A sorted count of the messages we received</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at raw metrics, we can see that it breaks down our program
into how many lines are code lines, python docstrings, standalone
comments, and empty lines. This is very useful, since it gives us an
idea of how well commented our code is. In this case - not very well
commented at all! For normal comments, the usually accepted wisdom is to
add them to explain <em>why</em> you are doing something, or perhaps to
explain how necessarily complex code works, but not to explain the
obvious, since clearly written code should do that itself.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>QUESTION: Who’s familiar with Python docstrings? Yes/No</p>
<p>Docstrings are a special kind of comment for a function, that explain
what the function does, the parameters it expects, and what is returned.
You can also write docstrings for classes, methods, and modules, but you
should usually aim to add docstring comments to your code wherever you
can, particularly for critical or complex functions.</p>
<p>Let’s add one to our code now, within the
<code>fahr_to_celsius</code> function.</p>

<p>We can instruct pylint to ignore any particular types of issues,
which is useful if they are not seen as important or pedantic, or we
need to see other types more clearly. For example, to ignore any unused
imports:</p>

<p>However, if we wanted to ignore this issue for the foreseeable
future, typing this in every time would be tiresome. Fortunately we can
specify a configuration file to pylint which specifies how we want to
interpret issues.</p>
<p>We do this by first using pylint to generate a default
<code>.pylintrc</code> file. It directs this as output to the shell, so
we need to redirect it to a file to capture it. Ensure you are in the
repository root directory, then:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb9">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

</div>
<p>If you edit this generated file you’ll notice there are many things
we can specify to pylint. For now, look for <code>disable=</code> and
add <code>C0301</code> to the list of ignored issues already present
that are separated by commas, e.g.:</p>
<pre class="text"><code># no Warning level messages displayed, use "--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W".
disable=C0301,

<p>Code linters like pylint help us to identify problems in our code,
such as code styling issues and potential errors, and importantly, if we
work in a team of developers such tools help us keep our code style
<em>consistent</em>. Attempting to understand a code base which employs
a variety of coding styles (perhaps even in the same source file) can be
remarkably difficult.</p>
<p>But there are some aspects we should be careful of when using linters
and interpreting their results:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>They don’t tell us that the code actually works</strong> and
they don’t tell us if the results our code produces are actually
correct, so we still need to test our code.</li>
<li>
<strong>They don’t give us any Idea of whether it’s a good
implementation</strong>, and that the technical choices are good ones.
For example, this code contains functions to conduct temperature
conversions, but it turns out there’s a number of well-maintained Python
packages that do this (e.g. <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytemperature/" class="external-link">pytemperature</a>)so we
should be using a tried and tested package instead of reinventing the
wheel.</li>
<li>
<strong>They also don’t tell us if the implementation is actually
fit for purpose</strong>. Even if the code is a good implementation, and
it works as expected, is it actually solving the <em>intended</em>
problem?</li>
<li>
<strong>They also don’t tell us anything about the data the program
uses</strong> which may have its own problems.</li>
<li>
<strong>A high score or zero warnings may give us false
confidence</strong>. Just because we have reached a 10.00 score, doesn’t
mean the code is actually <em>good</em> code, just that it’s likely well
formatted and hopefully easier to read and understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we have to be a bit careful. These are all valid, high-level
questions to ask while you’re writing code, both as a team, and also
individually. In the fog of development, it can be surprisingly easy to
lose track of what’s actually being implemented and how it’s being
implemented. A good idea is to revisit these questions regularly, to be
sure you can answer them!</p>
<p>However, whilst taking these shortcomings into account, linters are a
very low effort way to help us improve our code and keep it
consistent.</p>

<p>Basic Git training usually covers the essential concepts, such as
adding files, committing changes, viewing commit history, and checking
out or reverting to earlier versions. But for RSEs working in
collaborative, code-intensive projects, that is just the tip of the
iceberg. More detailed topics like branching and merging strategies, and
understanding merge conflicts are critical for managing code across
teams and maintaining clean, reproducible development workflows.</p>
<p>In this session we will explore branching and feature branch
workflow, a popular method for collaborative development using Git,
along with some intermediate Git features (merging, rebasing,
cherry-picking) and handling merge conflicts that can help streamline
your development workflow and avoid common pitfalls in collaborative
software development.</p>

</h3>
<p>You might be used to committing code directly, but not sure what
branches really are or why they matter? When you start a new Git
repository and begin committing, all changes go into a branch — by
default, this is usually called <code>main</code> (or
<code>master</code> in older repositories). The name <code>main</code>
is just a convention — a Git repository’s default branch can technically
be named anything.</p>
<p>Why not just always use <code>main</code> branch? While it is
possible to always commit to <code>main</code>, it is not ideal when
you’re collaborating with others, you are working on new features or
want to experiment with your code, and you want to keep main clean and
stable for your users and collaborators.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="feature-branch">Feature Branch<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#feature-branch"></a>
</h3>
<p>Creating a separate branch (often called a “feature” branch) allows
you to add or test code (containing a new “feature”) without affecting
the main line of development, work in parallel with collagues without
worrying that your code may break something for the rest of the team and
review and merge changes safely after testing using pull/merge
requests.</p>
<p>How do you decide when to use a new branch? You should consider
starting a new branch whenever you are working on a distinct feature or
fixing a specific bug. This allows you to collect a related set of
commits in one place, without interfering with other parts of the
project.</p>
<p>Branching helps separate concerns in your codebase, making
development, testing, and code review much easier. It also reduces the
chance of conflicts during collaborative work, especially when multiple
people are contributing to the same repository.</p>
<p>This approach is known as the <strong>feature branch
workflow</strong>. In this model, each new feature or fix lives in its
own branch. Once the work is complete and has been tested, the branch is
reviewed by project collaborators (other than the code author), any
merge conflicts addressed and the new work merged back into the main
branch. Using feature branches is an efficient way to manage changes,
collaborate effectively, and keep the main branch stable and
production-ready.</p>

<h3 id="merging">Merging<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#merging"></a>
</h3>
<p>When you are ready to bring the changes from your feature branch back
into the main branch, Git offers you to do a merge - a process that
unifies work done in 2 separate branches. Git will take two (or more -
you can merge more branches at the same time) commit pointers and
attempt to find a common base commit between them. Git has several
different methods to find a base commit - these methods are called
“merge strategies”. Once Git finds a common base commit it will create a
new “merge commit” that combines the changes of the specified merge
commits. Technically, a merge commit is a regular commit which just
happens to have two parent commits.</p>
<p>Each merge strategy is suited for a different scenario. The choice of
strategy depends on the complexity of changes and the desired outcome.
Let’s have a look at the most commonly used merge strategies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="fast-forward-merge">Fast Forward Merge<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fast-forward-merge"></a>
</h3>
<p>A fast-forward merge occurs when the main branch has not diverged
from the feature branch - meaning there are no new commits on the main
branch since the feature branch was created.</p>
<pre class="text"><code>A - B - C [main]
         \
          D - E [feature]</code></pre>
<p>In this case, Git simply moves the main branch pointer to the latest
commit in the feature branch. This strategy is simple and keeps the
commit history linear - i.e. the history is one straight line.</p>
<p>After a fast forward merge:</p>
<pre class="text"><code><span><span class="va">A</span> <span class="op">-</span> <span class="va">B</span> <span class="op">-</span> <span class="va">C</span> <span class="op">-</span> <span class="va">D</span> <span class="op">-</span> <span class="va">E</span> <span class="op">[</span><span class="va">main</span><span class="op">]</span><span class="op">[</span><span class="va">feature</span><span class="op">]</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="way-merge-with-merge-commit">3-Way Merge with Merge Commit<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#way-merge-with-merge-commit"></a>
</h3>
<p>A fast-forward merge is not possible if the main and the feature
branches have diverged.</p>
<pre class="text"><code>A - B - C - F [main]
         \
          D - E [feature]</code></pre>
<p>If you try to merge your feature branch changes into the main branch
and other changes have been made to main - regardless of whether these
changes create a conflict or not - Git will try to do a 3-way merge and
generate a merge commit.</p>
<p>A merge commit is a dedicated special commit that records the
combined changes from both branches and has two parent commits,
preserving the history of both lines of development. The name “3-way
merge” comes from the fact that Git uses three commits to generate the
merge commit - the two branch tips and their common ancestor to
reconstruct the changes that are to be merged.</p>
<pre class="text"><code>A - B - C - F - "MergeCommitG" [main]
         \     /
          D - E [feature]</code></pre>
<p>In addition, if the two branches you are trying to merge both changed
the same part of the same file, Git will not be able to figure out which
version to use and merge automatically. When such a situation occurs, it
stops right before the merge commit so that you can resolve the
conflicts manually before continuing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="rebase-and-merge">Rebase and Merge<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#rebase-and-merge"></a>
</h3>
<p>In Git, there is another way to integrate changes from one branch
into another: the rebase.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to an earlier example from the 3-way merge, where main
and feature branches have diverged with subsequent commits made on each
(so fast-forward merging strategy is not an option).</p>
<pre class="text"><code>A - B - C - F [main]
         \
          D - E [feature]</code></pre>
<p>When you rebase the feature branch with the main branch, Git replays
each commit from the feature branch on top of all the commits from the
main branch in order. This results in a cleaner, linear history that
looks as if the feature branch was started from the latest commit on
main.</p>
<p>So, all the changes introduced on feature branch (commits D and E)
are reapplied on top of commit F - becoming D’ and E’. Note that D’ and
E’ are rebased commits, which are actually new commits with different
SHAs but the same modifications as commits D and E.</p>
<pre class="text"><code>A - B - C - F [main]
             \
              D' - E' [feature]</code></pre>
<p>At this point, you can go back to the main branch and do a
fast-forward merge with feature branch.</p>
<p>Fast forward merge strategy is best used when you have a short-lived
feature branch that needs to be merged back into the main branch, and no
other changes have been made to the main branch in the meantime.</p>
<p>Rebase is ideal for feature branches that have fallen behind the main
development line and need updating. It is particularly useful before
merging long-running feature branches to ensure they apply cleanly on
top of the main branch. Rebasing maintains a linear history and avoids
merge commits (like fast forwarding), making it look as if changes were
made sequentially and as if you created your feature branch from a
different point in the repository’s history. A disadvantage is that it
rewrites commit history, which can be problematic for shared branches as
it requires force pushing.</p>

covered so far.</p>

<h3 id="squash-and-merge">Squash and Merge<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#squash-and-merge"></a>
</h3>
<p>Squash and merge squashes all the commits from a feature branch into
a single commit before merging into the main branch. This strategy
simplifies the commit history, making it easier to follow. This strategy
is ideal for merging feature branches with numerous small commits,
resulting in a cleaner main branch history.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>As your projects grow, you will occasionally need to manage your
local code history more precisely. Git offers a few useful features to
help you do just that — especially when you are not quite ready to
commit or want to isolate specific changes.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="git-stash-setting-changes-aside-for-later">Git Stash: Setting Changes Aside for Later<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#git-stash-setting-changes-aside-for-later"></a>
</h3>
<p>Imagine you are halfway through some code changes and suddenly need
to switch tasks or pull updates from the remote branch. Committing is
not ideal yet — so what do you do? Use <code>git stash</code> to safely
store your uncommitted changes in a local “stash”. This lets you clean
your working directory and avoid conflicts, without losing any work.
When you are ready, you can bring those changes back using
<code>git stash pop</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">

</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you want to take just one specific commit (say, from
another branch) and apply it to your current branch — without merging
the whole branch. That is where <code>git cherry-pick</code> command
comes in. It applies the changes from the chosen commit directly on top
of your current branch, as if you’d made them there all along.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="git-reset-rewinding-your-commit-history">Git Reset: Rewinding Your Commit History<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#git-reset-rewinding-your-commit-history"></a>
</h3>
<p>Made a commit too soon? <code>git reset</code> allows you to undo
commits locally. It moves your branch pointer back to an earlier commit,
turning those “undone” changes into uncommitted edits in your working
directory. It is handy for rewriting local history before sharing code —
but be careful using it on shared branches, as it alters commit
history.</p>

</div>
<p>If you have been through previous Byte-sized RSE episodes, you may
have already encountered a version of this code before!</p>
<p>It’s designed to perform some temperature conversions from fahrenheit
to either celsius or kelvin, and the code here is for illustrative
purposes. If we actually wanted to do temperature conversions, there are
at least three existing Python packages we would ideally use instead
that would do this for us (and much better). Similarly, this code should
also use a library to handle the CSV data files, as opposed to handling
them line by line itself.</p>
<p>There are also a number of other rather large issues (which should be
emphasised is deliberate!):</p>
<ul>
<li>The code is quite untidy, with inconsistent spacing and commenting
which makes it harder to understand.</li>
<li>It contains a hardcoded file path, as opposed to having them within
a separate configuration file or passed in as an argument.</li>
<li>Function names are capitalised - perhaps we need to change these to
be lower case, and use underscores between words - a naming style also
known as snake case.</li>
<li>The code is also some comments (known as docstrings) describing the
function and the script (or module) itself. For those that haven’t
encountered docstrings yet, they are special comments described in a
particular format that describe what the function or module is supposed
to do. You can see an example here in the <code>FahrToCelsius</code>
function, where the docstring explains what the function does, its input
arguments, and what it returns.</li>
<li>An incorrect function name <code>FahrToCels</code>, which should be
<code>FahrToCelsius</code>. This will cause it to fail if we try to run
it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing to note on this repository is that we have a single
main branch (also used to be called a master branch) which you may see
in older repositories. You’ll also notice some commits on the main
branch already. One way to look at this is as a single “stream” of
development. We’ve made changes to this codebase one after the other on
this main branch, however, it might be that we may want to add a new
software feature, or fix a bug in our code later on. This may take,
maybe, more than a few commits to complete and make it work, perhaps
over a matter of hours or days. Of course, as we make changes to make
this feature work, the commits along the way may well break the
“working” nature of our repository and after that, users getting hold of
our software by cloning the repo, also get a version of the software
that then isn’t working. This is also true for developers as well: for
example, it’s very hard to develop a new feature for a piece of software
if you don’t start with software that is already working. The problem
would also become compounded if other developers become involved,
perhaps as part of a new project that will develop the software. What
would be really helpful would be to be able to do all these things
whilst always maintaining working code in our repository. Fortunately,
version control allows us to create and use <em>separate branches</em>
in addition to the main branch, which will not interfere with our
working code on the main branch.</p>

<p>Before we look into branches, let’s create a few new issues on our
repository, to represent some work we’re going to do in this
session.</p>
<p>One thing that might be good to do is to tidy up our code. So let’s
add issues to fix that script function naming bug, changing our function
names to use snake case, and add the missing docstrings.</p>
<p>Let’s create our first issue about using snake case:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to your new repository in GitHub in a browser, and select
<code>Issues</code> at the top. You’ll notice a new page with no issues
listed at present.</li>
<li>Select <code>New issue</code>.</li>
<li>On the issue creation page, add something like the following:
<ul>
<li>In the title add: Functions should use snake case naming style</li>
<li>In the description add: Naming of functions currently is using
capitalisation, and needs to follow snake case naming instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We can also assign people to this issue (in the top right), and for
the purposes of this activity, let’s assign ourselves, so select
<code>Assign yourself</code>.</li>
<li>Select <code>Create</code> to create the issue.</li>

<p>We’ll start by working on the missing docstring issue. For the
purpose of this activity, let’s assume that the bug which causes the
script to fail is being tackled by someone else.</p>
<p>So let’s create a feature branch, and work on adding that docstring,
using that branch. But before we do, let’s take a look and see what’s
already there.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="examining-existing-repository-branches">Examining Existing Repository Branches<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#examining-existing-repository-branches"></a>

<p>We’ve already checked out our new repository, and can see what
branches it currently has by doing:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb1">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

<pre class="output" tabindex="0"><code>* main</code></pre>
</div>
<p>And we can see we have only our main branch, with an asterisk to
indicate it’s the current branch we’re on.</p>
<p>We can also use <code>-a</code> to show us all branches:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb3">

</div>
<p>Note the other two <code>remotes/origin</code> branches, which are
references to the remote repository we have on GitHub. In this case, a
reference to the equivalent <code>main</code> branch in the remote
repository. <code>HEAD</code> here, as you may know, refers to the
latest commit, so this refers to the latest commit on the main branch
(which is where we are now). You can think of <code>origin</code> as a
stand-in for the full repository URL. Indeed, if we do the following, we
can see the full URL for <code>origin</code>:</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-new-branch">Creating a new Branch<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-a-new-branch"></a>
</h3>
<p>So, in order to get started on our docstring work, let’s tell git to
create a new branch.</p>
<p>When we name the branch, it’s considered good practice to include the
issue number (if there is one), and perhaps something useful about the
issue, in the name of the feature branch. This makes it easier to see
what this branch was about:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb9">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode bash" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> branch issue-2-missing-docstrings</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now if we use the following, we can see that our new branch has been
created:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb10">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode bash" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> branch</span></code></pre>
</div>
<div class="codewrapper">
<h3 class="code-label">OUTPUT<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="output" tabindex="0"><code>  issue-2-missing-docstrings
* main</code></pre>
</div>
<p>However, note that the asterisk indicates that we are still on our
main branch, and any commits at this point will still go on this main
branch and not our new one. We can verify this by doing
<code>git status</code>:</p>
<div class="codewrapper">
<h3 class="code-label">OUTPUT<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="output" tabindex="0"><code>On branch main
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean</code></pre>
</div>
<p>QUESTION: who’s created their new feature branch? Yes/No</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="switching-to-the-new-branch">Switching to the New Branch<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#switching-to-the-new-branch"></a>
</h3>
<p>So what we need to do now is to switch to this new branch, which we
can do via:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb13">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode bash" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> checkout issue-2-missing-docstrings</span></code></pre>
</div>
<div class="codewrapper">
<h3 class="code-label">OUTPUT<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="output" tabindex="0"><code>Switched to branch 'issue-2-missing-docstrings'</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now if we do <code>git branch</code> again, we can see we’re on the
new branch. And if we do <code>git status</code> again, this verifies
we’re on this new branch.</p>
<p>Using <code>git status</code> before you do anything is a good habit.
It helps to clarify on which branch you’re working, and also any
outstanding changes you may have forgotten about.</p>
<p>Now, one thing that’s important to realise, is that the contents of
the new branch are at the state at which we created the branch. If we do
<code>git log</code>, to show us the commits, we can see they are the
same as when we first cloned the repository (i.e. from the first
commit). So any commits we do now, will be on our new feature branch and
will depart from this commit on the main branch, and be separate from
any other commits that occur on the main branch.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now we’re on our feature branch, we can make some changes to fix this
issue. So open up the <code>climate_analysis.py</code> file in an editor
of your choice.</p>
<p>Then add the following to the <code>FahrToKelvin</code> function
(just below the function declaration):</p>

<p>Then save the file.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Who has added this to the file, and saved it? Yes/No</p>
<p>Now we’ve done this, let’s commit this change to the repository on
our new branch.</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb16">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

</div>
<p>Notice we’ve added in the issue number and a short description to the
commit message here. If you’ve never seen this before, this is
considered good practice. We’ve created an issue describing the problem,
and in the commit, we reference that issue number explicitly. Later,
we’ll see GitHub will pick up on this, and in this issue, we’ll be able
to see the commits associated with this issue.</p>
<p>Now we’ve also got a module docstring to add as well, so let’s add
that. Open up our editor on this file again, and add the following to
the top of the file:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb17">
<h3 class="code-label">PYTHON<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

</div>
<p>Then, add and commit this change:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb18">

<p>So again, we’re committing this change against issue number 2. Now
let’s look at our new branch:</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We’ve essentially fixed the docstring issue now, so next we need to
somehow merge these changes on our feature branch with the main
branch.</p>
<div id="test-code-before-you-push-it" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="test-code-before-you-push-it" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Test Code Before you Push it!</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Now before we this, ordinarily we should test the changes and ensure
the code is working properly. To save time, we haven’t done that here,
but that’s definitely something worth noting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before pushing any changes, always manually test your code
first.</li>
<li>If you have any unit tests, run those too to check that your changes
haven’t broken anything.</li>
<li>Particularly if this was a change implementing a new feature,
consider writing a new unit test to test that feature.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>And we’ll do that now by using what’s known as a <em>pull
request</em>. A pull request is a way to propose changes on a particular
Git branch, and request they be merged with another branch. They’re
really useful as a tool in teams, since they provide a way to check the
changes before doing a merge. They allow you to see the changes to files
across all the commits in the branch, and look at how these commits will
change the codebase. And you can assign a number of reviewers to review
the pull request, and submit a review with their thoughts on whether to
accept the pull request, or make changes, and so on. Really useful! So
we could create the pull request on the command line, but we’ll use the
GitHub interface to do it. Which frankly, is much clearer and gives you
a far better view of what’s going on.</p>
<p>So let’s go back to our repository on GitHub. You may see a message
displayed at the top about protecting the main branch. We may come back
to this later, so no need to worry about this for now.</p>
<p>If we select the dropdown where it says “main”, it gives us a list of
branches. We can see all branches by selecting that option at the
bottom. Now, we can see we have our new branch that has appeared, which
is separate from our main branch. If we select that, we can see the
state of the repository within this branch, including the new latest
commits here - on our <code>climate-analysis.py</code> file.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="create-a-pull-request">Create a Pull Request<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#create-a-pull-request"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Let’s create the pull request now, by selecting
<code>Compare &amp; pull request</code>. We could also do this from the
<code>Pull requests</code> tab from the top menu as well, then selecting
<code>New pull request</code>.</p>
<p>Now it shows us an interface for creating the pull request: -
Importantly, at the top, it shows us which branch will be merged with
which branch, with the source (or comparison) branch on the right, and
the destination branch on the left. This should be our new branch for
<code>compare:</code>, and <code>main</code> for <code>base:</code>. -
It tells us we are “able to merge” - and in this case, there are no
conflicts to worry about, which is really useful to know. So what if
there are conflicts? This is something we’ll look at later. - Below
this, it also shows us the commits associated with this branch as well
as the sum of changes to the files by these commits.</p>
<p>In the title, we’ll rename the PR to reference issue 2 directly,
changing it to <code>Fixes #2 - missing docstrings</code>. We could add
more contextual information in the description if needed. We could also
assign others as reviewers, as we did in the previous session on code
review. But for simplicity, we’ll leave those for now. But we will
assign the pull request (or PR for short) to ourselves, since it’s a
good idea to assign responsibility where we can. So let’s create the
pull request by selecting the button.</p>
<p>QUESTION: who’s created the pull request? Yes/No</p>
<p>Now we get another screen describing the new PR itself. If we’d
assigned any reviewers, we now wait for their reviews of this pull
request. At this point, we could assume we’ve just done that, and the PR
has been approved and is ready to merge.</p>
<p>By contributing work in PRs, and having reviews of PRs, it’s not just
a number of people making changes in isolation. In collaborations around
software, it’s very important to increase the flow of information
between people making changes, in case there are any new potential
issues that are introduced. And PRs give us that discipline - an
opportunity really - to make sure that the changes we are making are
well considered. This then becomes part of the overall cycle of
development: we write code, we have it reviewed, it gets merged. But
also, we help with reviewing other code too.</p>
<p>Coming back to the interface, it now tells us we can merge this
branch automatically, and also the list of commits involved.
Interestingly, even though we have created this PR to do a merge, we
could continue developing our code on this new branch indefinitely if we
wanted. We could make and push new commits to this branch, which would
show up here, and we then merge at a future date. This may be
particularly useful if we need to have a longer discussion about the PR
as it is developing. The discussion would be captured in the comments
for the PR, and when ready, we then merge the PR.</p>

</div>
<div id="how-long-should-prs-be-open" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">How Long should PRs be Open?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Which raises the question, of how long should PRs be open, or
branches for that matter? To some degree, this depends on the nature of
the changes being made But branches in Git are designed, and should be
wherever possible, short-lived. The longer a branch is open, the more
potential changes could be made to the main branch. Then when it comes
time to merge the branch, we may get a lot of conflicts we need to
manage. So generally, it’s a good idea to keep your branches open for a
day or two, a few days maximum, before creating a PR and doing a merge
if you can. Note that we can also see this PR, as well as any others, by
selecting the <code>Pull request</code> tab.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>You’ll notice there’s a subtle dropdown on the
<code>Merge pull request</code> button, which presents options forhow to
perform the merge.</p>
<p>FIXME: ensure rebase and merge is covered in intro?</p>
<p>You may remember from the introduction about doing a “rebase and
merge” as opposed to just doing a merge commit, since it leads to a
cleaner repository history. For example, if we did a normal merge here,
we’d end up with our two new commits and a merge commit on the
<code>main</code> branch. But if we do a rebase and then merge, our two
commits are essentially just added to the top of the <code>main</code>
branch. Let’s use this method, by selecting the third option in the
dropdown: <code>Rebase and merge</code>.</p>
<p>Note that if there had been a conflict with any commits on the main
branch, we very likely wouldn’t have been able to merge using this
method. Which in itself is a good question: even if we’d done a straight
commit directly to the <code>main</code> branch, what would happen if
there was a conflict? If we have time, we’ll look at this later</p>

<div id="the-golden-rule-of-rebasing" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">The Golden Rule of Rebasing</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Note that you can also do rebasing with branches on the command line.
But a word of warning: when doing this, be sure you know what will
happen.</p>
<p>Rebasing in this way rewrites the repository’s history, and
therefore, with rebasing, there is a GOLDEN RULE which states that you
should only rebase with a local branch, never a public (shared) branch
you suspect is being used by others. When rebasing, you’re re-writing
the history of commits, so if someone else has the repository on their
own machine and has worked on a particular branch, if you rebase on that
branch, the history will have changed, and they will run into
difficulties when pushing their changes due to the rewritten history. It
can get quite messy, so if in doubt, do a standard merge!</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>So now let’s go ahead and select <code>Rebase pull request</code>. We
can add more information here if needed - but let’s
<code>Confirm rebase and merge</code>. Note that it says that the merge
was done successfully, and suggests we can delete the branch.</p>
<p>QUESTION: who has merged the pull request? Yes/No</p>
<p>We said earlier that branches in Git should be short lived where
possible, and keeping branches hanging around may cause confusion. So
let’s delete it now. Now if we go the main branch on the main repository
page in GitHub, we can see that the changes have been merged. And if we
look at “commits”, we can see the commits we made on our feature branch
have been added to the main branch.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="see-commits-on-issues">See Commits on Issues<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#see-commits-on-issues"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now, remember those commit messages with the issue numbers in them?
If we go to our issues, we can see them with the commits associated with
those issues, which are listed in chronological order. This is really
handy when checking on issue progress. Plus, it means the reason behind
each commit is now traceable back to the originating issue. So why are
there two sets of commits, when we only made one? That’s because we
first made two commits to the branch, and then, using a rebase method,
we applied our commits to the main branch.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="summary">Summary<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#summary"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>So what are the benefits so far?</p>
<ul>
<li>By using different feature branches, as opposed to just committing
directly to the main branch, we’ve isolated the “churn” of developing a
feature from the main branch. This makes the work on any single branch
easier to understand as a thread of work.</li>
<li>It gives us the opportunity to abandon a branch entirely, with no
need to manually change things back. In such a case, all we need to do
is delete the branch.</li>
<li>From a single developer’s perspective, we are also effectively
isolated from the changes being made on other feature branches. So when
a number of changes are being made, we still (hopefully!) only have to
worry about our own changes.</li>
<li>It gives us a process that helps us maintain a working version of
the code on <code>main</code> for our users (which may very well include
ourselves!), as long as we ensure that work on other branches is
properly tested and works as expected before we merge back to the
<code>main</code> branch.</li>
<li>It also gives us a mechanism - via pull requests - to have others
review our code before changes are introduced into the codebase.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what we’ve shown is one way to use feature branch workflow, By
using feature branches directly off the main branch, and merging to
<code>main</code> when these changes are ready. We’ve chosen this way
for the training, since it’s more straightforward to teach in a
practical activity, but there are other “branching strategies” you can
use. Another way is to use a long-lived branch off of main, called
usually something like <code>dev</code> or <code>develop</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This <code>dev</code> branch represents a general branch of
development.</li>
<li>Feature branches are created off of the <code>dev</code> branch
instead of <code>main</code>, and then merged back to the
<code>dev</code> branch.</li>
<li>Later, when a release of the software is due, or at an appropriate
point after the software has been tested, the <code>dev</code> branch is
merged with the main branch.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach gives development greater distance from the main
branch, and it means you can merge and test all changes together on the
<code>dev</code> branch before you merge with the <code>main</code>
branch, to ensure it all works together first. However, it also means
when it comes to merging back to <code>main</code>, it can be more
difficult since the <code>dev</code> branch could have built up a
considerable number of changes that need to be merged. In either case,
the key is to make sure that code is tested and checked with the right
people in your team before you merge to <code>main</code>.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now we still have two remaining issues we can look at. Interestingly,
both of them require changes that can cause a conflict when merging, so
let’s look at those now.</p>
<p>First, let’s go to the <code>main</code> branch and pull the
repository changes on this branch to our local repository. Generally,
it’s good practice to use <code>git pull</code> to synchronise your
local repo with the GitHub one before doing any further work.</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb1">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode bash" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> checkout main</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> pull</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> log</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>So now, again, we have those two commits on main as we would expect.
Let’s create a feature branch to fix our snake-case issue.</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb2">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

<pre class="sourceCode bash" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> branch issue-1-use-snake-case</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> checkout issue-1-use-snake-case</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>So now, edit the <code>climate_analysis.py</code> file, and change
functions to use a snake case style, e.g. change
<code>FahrToCelsius</code> to <code>fahr_to_celsius</code>. Remember to
also change the one in the <code>fahr_to_kelvin</code> function as
well.</p>
<p>Note we’ve changed the call to <code>fahrtocelsius</code> near the
bottom. let’s commit this to our new feature branch:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb3">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

<p>At this point, we could follow this advice and merge this branch’s
work into the <code>main</code> branch, which would be very neat and
tidy. But life is rarely like that: what happens when someone else
commits their changes in some way to the main branch? Where does that
leave us when we come to merge?</p>
<p>You may recall we created an issue for fixing the function call to
the <code>FahrToCelsius</code> function, where the call referenced the
function incorrectly. Let’s assume that a colleague has made these
changes, and updated the <code>main</code> branch. Let’s pretend we’re
our colleague, and we’re making this fix to the main branch. First,
let’s switch to the main branch:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb5">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> log</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now as we can see, this main branch is completely unaware of the
commits in our new feature branch, and is at the initial state of the
repository. Let’s make the fix. Now we could (and should) create a
feature branch here, make and commit the change, then merge with the
main branch. But for expediency, we’ll commit directly to the main
branch, and assume they did it the right way. Edit the
<code>climate_analysis.py</code> file, and update the
<code>FahrToCels</code> function call to <code>FahrToCelsius</code>, and
save the changes.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now let’s see what happens when we create a pull request on our
feature branch, as before, and try to merge. Again, let’s go to GitHub
and then:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to <code>Pull requests</code>, and select
<code>New pull request</code>.</li>
<li>Select the new feature branch
<code>issue-1-use-snake-case</code>.</li>
<li>Select this new branch in <code>compare:</code>, and ensure that
<code>base:</code> says <code>main</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that now it says we can’t automatically perform this merge.
Essentially, it’s compared the source and destination branches, and
determined that there is a conflict, since there are different edits on
the same line for commits in the <code>main</code> and feature branch.
But we’ll go ahead and create the PR anyway:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Select <code>Create pull request</code>.</li>
<li>For the title, add “Fixes #1 - use snake case naming”.</li>
<li>Assign yourself to the issue.</li>
<li>Select <code>Create pull request</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We should now see that “This branch has conflicts that must be
resolved”. And in this case, there is only one conflicting file -
<code>climate_analysis..py</code>, but there could be more than one. Now
we can attempt to resolve the conflict by selecting
<code>Resolve conflicts</code>.</p>
<p>The GitHub interface is really useful here. It tells you which files
have the conflicts on the left (only <code>climate_analysis.py</code> in
this case), and where in each file the conflicts are. So let’s fix the
conflict. Near the bottom, we can see that our snake case naming of that
function call conflicts with the fix to it, and this has caused a
conflict.</p>
<p>Now importantly we have to decide how to resolve the conflict.
Fortunately, our fix for the snake_case issue resolves this issue as
well, since we’re calling the function correctly, which makes the other
fix redundant. So let’s remove the other fix, by editing out the chevron
and equals parts, and the fix we don’t want. We then select
<code>Mark as resolved</code>, then <code>Commit merge</code>. Now
unfortunately, due to the conflict commit, we can no longer rebase and
merge. So select the option to create a <code>Merge commit</code>, then
select <code>Merge pull request</code>, and <code>Confirm merge</code>.
And as before, delete the feature branch which is no longer needed.</p>

<p>This session introduces key practices for effective coding and

work together on code through structured approaches such as code review,
understand common workflows and tools that support collaborative
development, and explore the processes that help maintain code quality
and team productivity. We will then take a practical look at how to
carry out code reviews using GitHub, one of the most widely used
platforms for collaborative software development.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Software development thrives on collaboration, even when much of the
coding is done individually. Getting input from others can have a big
impact on the quality, maintainability, and effectiveness of your work,
often requiring only a small investment of time. Since there is rarely a
single “perfect” way to solve a problem, working with others allows you
to share knowledge, skills, and perspectives, leading to better
solutions and new insights. Through collaboration, you can learn new
techniques, discover tools and infrastructure that streamline
development, and help build a shared understanding that benefits the
wider team or community.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-coding-with-others">What are the Benefits of Coding With Others?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-are-the-benefits-of-coding-with-others"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are many benefits to coding with others. Collaborative coding
practices — such as pair programming, code reviews, and shared
repositories — can help catch bugs earlier, improve code readability,
and increase overall code quality. It also fosters shared ownership of
the codebase, making it easier for teams to maintain and extend code
over time.</p>
<p>Importantly, it is best to adopt collaborative tools and practices
before they become urgent. Setting up processes, code sharing and
collaboration platforms (like GitHub or GitLab), and development
workflows early on means you will be ready to handle code review,
version control, and team communication smoothly when collaboration
intensifies. Early investment in collaboration infrastructure pays off
by preventing confusion and bottlenecks later in a project.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="what-is-code-review">What is Code Review?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-code-review"></a>
</h3>
<p>Code review is the process of examining and discussing someone else’s
code with the goal of checking its correctness and improving its quality
and readability at the point when the code changes. It is a key
collaborative and software quality assurance practice in software
development that can help identify bugs early, ensure consistency with
coding standards, and support knowledge sharing across a team.</p>
<p>Code review is valuable at all stages of the software development
lifecycle — from initial design through development to ongoing
maintenance — but it is best to incorporate it right from the start.
According to Michael Fagan, the author of the <em>code inspection</em>
technique, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5388086" class="external-link">rigorous inspections
can remove 60-90% of errors from the code even before the first tests
are run</a>. Furthermore, according to Fagan, the cost to remedy a
defect in the early (design) stage is 10 to 100 times less compared to
fixing the same defect in the development and maintenance stages,
respectively. Since the cost of bug fixes grows in orders of magnitude
throughout the software lifecycle, it is far more efficient to find and
fix defects as close as possible to the point where they are
introduced.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="why-do-code-reviews">Why do Code Reviews?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-do-code-reviews"></a>
</h3>
<p>Code review is very useful for all the parties involved - code author
as well as reviewers - someone checks your design or code for errors and
gets to learn from your solution; having to explain code to someone else
clarifies your rationale and design decisions in your mind too. In
general, code reviews help improve code quality, catch bugs early, and
promote shared understanding among team members. They also support skill
development and encourage consistent coding practices across a
project.</p>
<p>The specific aims of a code review can vary depending on the context
— for example, production-ready code might undergo rigorous scrutiny,
while early-stage prototypes may be reviewed more informally for general
structure and approach. Code reviews can follow a more formal process
(e.g. structured pull requests with approval workflows) or take an
informal shape (e.g. ad hoc peer review or pair programming), depending
on the needs of the project and the team.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="code-review-types">Code Review Types<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#code-review-types"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are several types of code review, each suited to different
contexts and goals.</p>
<p>An <em>informal review</em> involves casually asking a colleague for
input or advice. This type of review is often used to improve
understanding, share skills, or get help with problem-solving, rather
than enforce specific standards. Some examples include
<em>over-the-shoulder code review</em> (when one developer talks the
other developer through the code changes while sitting at the same
machine) and <em>pair programming</em> (when two developers work on the
code at the same time with one of them actively coding and the other
providing real-time feedback).</p>
<p>A <em>code modification &amp; contrubution-based review</em> occurs
when changes or additions to a codebase are reviewed as they happen —
commonly used in version-controlled software development workflows like
GitHub’s pull requests. This approach is a bit more formal
(e.g. structured pull requests with approval workflows) and
tool-assisted, and focuses on ensuring understanding, clarity,
maintainability, and code quality.</p>
<p>A more rigorous and formal method is the <em>structured codebase
review</em>, such as a <em>Fagan inspection</em>, where a team examines
a codebase systematically, following strict criteria to identify defects
or ensure conformance to standards. While this method can be highly
effective, it is resource-intensive and less common in the research
software community (but it does occur). It focuses generally on
conformance to processes and practices and identifying defects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="code-review-practices-processes">Code Review Practices &amp; Processes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#code-review-practices-processes"></a>
</h3>
<p>In this session, we will focus on code review practices centered
around code modifications and contributions. The aim is to integrate
code review into the research software development process in a way that
is lightweight, low-stakes, and easy to adopt. Even a short initial code
review can have a significant impact. As highlighted in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Best-Kept-Secrets-Peer-Review/dp/1599160676" class="external-link">“Best
Kept Secrets of Peer Code Review” by Jason Cohen</a>, the first hour of
review is the most critical and productive, with diminishing returns
thereafter.</p>
<p>The goal is to strike a practical balance: invest enough time to
offer useful, actionable feedback without turning reviews into a
bottleneck. When reviewing code, focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code quality - is the code clear and readable? Do functions serve a
single purpose? Is it well-structured and consistent with the rest of
the project?</li>
<li>Best practices and conventions - is the project’s coding style
followed? Are tests and documentation included and up to date?</li>
<li>Efficiency and minimalism - does the change duplicate existing
functionality (found elsewhere in the code or in a third-party library)?
Is it limited to what’s required by the issue or ticket?</li>
<li>Knowledge sharing: ask clarifying questions (do not assume you
understand everything or know best) and offer respectful, specific
feedback. This helps everyone learn and builds team trust.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the value of that first hour, keep your efforts targeted. Do
not spend time on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linting or style issues - automated tools or CI pipelines should
catch these</li>
<li>Hunting for bugs, unless something clearly looks wrong — instead,
check that tests exist for various cases that should catch bugs</li>
<li>Fixing unrelated legacy issues that pre-date the change — log those
separately to avoid scope creep</li>
<li>Architectural overhauls — save big-picture changes for design
discussions or dedicated meetings to decide whether the code needs to be
restructured</li>
<li>Refactoring everything — provide only a few critical suggestions and
aim for incremental improvement, not perfection.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, code review often involves following a
<em>project-specific checklist</em> to ensure consistency and alignment
with coding standards. The process is typically <em>iterative</em>, with
reviewers and contributors engaging in a cycle of discussion, updates,
and re-review to address questions and refine changes before
integration. If a conversation is taking place in a code review that has
not been resolved by one or two back-and-forth exchange, then consider
scheduling a conversation or a pair programming session to discuss
things further (and record the outcome of the discussion - e.g. in the
pull requests’s comments). This way - you can enhance code quality and
collaborative learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="code-review-tools-platforms">Code Review Tools &amp; Platforms<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#code-review-tools-platforms"></a>
</h3>
<p>Modern source code management (SCM) tools such as Git, Mercurial, and
Subversion are well suited for conducting code reviews focused on
changes or contributions. These tools track modifications and provide
clear “diffs” (differences) that make it easier to inspect code updates
line-by-line.</p>
<p>On top of these, various higher-level software development support
platforms — such as GitHub, Review Board, JetBrains Space, and Atlassian
Crucible — offer additional features and tools to streamline the review
process, including inline comments to facilitate discussions, approval
workflows, and integration with issue trackers. Many projects also adopt
custom workflows tailored to their specific needs, balancing formality
and flexibility to best support their development practices.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now the next thing, is perhaps a bit later on, we decide to fix the
issue So we navigate to the README (go to repository main page) And
here, for the sake of the exercise, we’ll just use GitHub’s edit
mechanism to edit the file directly Alternatively, and in most cases,
we’d probably do this by having the repository cloned on our machine,
and then we’d make the change, and submit it that way But in the
interests of time and simplicity, we’ll just use GitHub’s edit function
So select the edit icon And edit the README to fix the link (remove the
bit that says “typo/”)</p>
<p>So we now need to commit the change, so we now select “Commit
changes” in the top right Good practice when committing a change is to
refer to the issue number in the commit message This gives us
traceability for changes back to the originating issue We had our issue
number 1, so let’s refer to that #1 - Fix broken article link We could
optionally put more info about the fix in the description if we
wanted</p>
<p>Now importantly, we want to submit this change as a pull request on a
new branch This will allow others to review that pull request Selecting
the second option here allows us to create a new branch for these
changes And we can give this new branch an identifiable name
readme-broken-link-fix</p>
<p>Once we select propose changes, this change is submitted and our new
branch, with that fix, is created And scrolling down, we can see our
change highlighted</p>
<p>QUESTION: who’s managed to commit their fix to a new branch?
Yes/No</p>

<p>Let’s now adopt a new role - that of the reviewer of a pull request
(or PR for short). Let’s assume that a colleague has created a pull
request of his own, for the purposes of this exercise, it’s on their own
repository But it could be a shared repository we are both working on In
a collaborative environment, this is mostly likely going to be the case
So let’s take a look at it and review it</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="write-a-review-of-the-pr">Write a Review of the PR<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#write-a-review-of-the-pr"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>So we open the repo URL link in a browser, and go to “Pull requests”
on the repo main page Then select the pull request To review the
request’s changes, we can go to ‘Files changed’ - one of the tabs Which
perhaps unsurprisingly, shows us the changes in each file, in this case
just one file, and one change The view on the left (in red) is the old
version, and the view on the right (in green), is the revised version of
the line change</p>
<p>We have the option of adding comments or suggestions inline to the
proposed changes, if we want For example, perhaps we know there is a
Zenodo record for the code that this article points to, which we think
should be added By hovering over a line and selecting the ‘+’ symbol at
the start of the line And adding a comment So select the changed line,
and add something like We should also link to the Zenodo record for the
code that this article links to, at <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/250494#.Y2UUN-zP1R4" class="external-link uri">https://zenodo.org/record/250494#.Y2UUN-zP1R4</a> Then
selecting ‘Start a review’ Can add as many comments as we want If this
were a larger pull request, we would review the other changes, and add
comments as needed</p>
<p>So let’s assume we’ve done that</p>
<p>Finally, as a reviewer of this pull request, we “Finish our review”
We can add a comment, maybe with some high-level observations or
suggestions Overall, the changes look good, although we should consider
adding the Zenodo repository link.</p>
<p>And then we can select whether (three options here) Comment - we can
just leave a comment to consider Approve - the pull request is approved
as is Request changes - there are some aspects that must be addressed
before it can be merged For simplicity, let’s just go with the first
option for this exercise</p>
<div id="the-approve-and-request-changes-options-are-unavailable" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="the-approve-and-request-changes-options-are-unavailable" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">The <code>Approve</code> and
<code>Request changes</code> options are unavailable!</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>If you’re following through the material on your own, and have
reviewed your own pull request, you’ll notice that the
<code>Approve</code> and <code>Request changes</code> options are not
available. This is because GitHub does not allow users to approve their
own pull requests. The reason for this is that it goes against the
reason behind pull requests - to have others review your changes, and in
a usual team environment, you’d ask a colleague (or colleagues) to do a
review.</p>
<p>GitHub still allows you to submit a review to your PRs with comments
however, so for the purposes of this training feel free to select the
<code>Comment</code> option instead.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So then submit the review, and our role as reviewer on the pull
request is complete The other participant can then take our review into
account, when deciding whether to merge that pull request</p>
<p>QUESTION: Who’s submitted a very brief code review? Yes/No</p>

the review, and any observations or suggestions made At this point, we

assuming their review is positive (and they don’t suggest more changes
are required) We can go ahead and merge the pull request into our

<p>Testing is a critical part of writing reliable, maintainable code —
especially in collaborative or research environments where
reproducibility and correctness are key. In this session, we will
explore why testing matters, and introduce different levels of testing —
from small, focused unit tests, to broader integration and system tests
that check how components work together. We will also look at testing
approaches such as regression testing (to ensure changes do not break
existing behavior) and property-based testing (to test a wide range of
inputs automatically). Finally, we will cover mocking, a technique used
to isolate code during tests by simulating the behavior of external
dependencies.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="introduction-to-testing">Introduction to testing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction-to-testing"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Code testing is the process of verifying that your code behaves as
expected and continues to do so as it evolves. It helps catch bugs
early, ensures changes do not unintentionally break existing
functionality, and supports the development of more robust and
maintainable software. Whether you’re working on a small script or a
large application, incorporating testing into your workflow builds
confidence in your code and makes collaboration and future updates much
easier.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="why-test-your-code">Why test your code?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-test-your-code"></a>
</h3>
<p>Being able to demonstrate that a process generates the right results
is important in any field of research, whether it is software generating
those results or not. So when writing software we need to ask ourselves
some key questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the code we develop works as expected?</li>
<li>To what extent are we confident of the accuracy of results that
software produces?</li>
<li>Can we and others verify these assertions for themselves?</li>
</ul>
<p>If we are unable to demonstrate that our software fulfills these
criteria, why would anyone use it?</p>
<p>As a codebase grows, debugging becomes more challenging, and new code
may introduce bugs or unexpected behavior in parts of the system it does
not directly interact with. Tests can help catch issues before they
become runtime bugs, and a failing test can pinpoint the source of the
problem. Additionally, tests serve as invocation examples for other
developers and users, making it easier for them to reuse the code
effectively.</p>
<p>Having well-defined tests for our software helps ensure your software
works correctly, reliably, and consistently over time. By identifying
bugs early and confirming that new changes do not break existing
functionality, testing improves code quality, reduces the risk of errors
in production, and makes future development and long-term maintenance
faster and safer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="types-of-testing---levels">Types of Testing - Levels<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#types-of-testing---levels"></a>
</h3>
<p>Testing can be performed at different code levels, each serving a
distinct purpose to ensure software behaves correctly at various stages
of execution. Together, these testing levels provide a structured
approach to improving software quality and reliability.</p>
<p><em>Unit testing</em> is the most granular level, where individual
components—like functions or classes—are tested in isolation to confirm
they behave correctly under a variety of inputs. This makes it easier to
identify and fix bugs early in the development process.</p>
<p><em>Integration testing</em> builds on unit testing by checking how
multiple components or modules work together. This level of testing
helps catch issues that arise when components interact — such as
unexpected data formats, interface mismatches, or dependency
problems.</p>
<p>At the highest level, system testing evaluates the software as a
complete, integrated system. This type of testing focuses on validating
the entire application’s functionality from end to end, typically from
the user’s perspective, including inputs, outputs, and how the system
behaves under various conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="types-of-testing---approaches">Types of Testing - Approaches<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#types-of-testing---approaches"></a>
</h3>
<p>Different approaches to code testing help ensure that software
behaves as expected under a range of conditions. When the expected
output of a function or program is known, tests can directly check that
the results match fixed values or fall within a defined confidence
interval.</p>
<p>However, for cases where exact outputs are not predictable — such as
simulations with random elements — <em>property-based testing</em> is
useful. This method tests a wide range of inputs to ensure that certain
properties or patterns hold true across them.</p>
<p>Another important approach is <em>regression testing</em>, which
helps detect when previously working functionality breaks due to recent
changes in the code. By rerunning earlier tests, developers can catch
and address these regressions early, maintaining software stability over
time.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="mocking">Mocking<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mocking"></a>
</h4>
<p>When running tests, you often want to focus on testing a specific
piece of functionality, but dependencies on external objects or
functions can complicate this, as you cannot always be sure they work as
expected. Mocking addresses this by allowing you to replace those
dependencies with “mocked” objects or functions that behave according to
your instructions. So, <em>mocking</em> is a testing approach used to
isolate the unit of code being tested by replacing its dependencies with
simplified, controllable versions — known as <em>mocks</em>.</p>
<p>Mocks mimic the behavior of real components (such as databases, APIs,
or external services) without requiring their full functionality or
availability. This allows developers to test specific code paths,
simulate error conditions, or verify how a unit interacts with other
parts of the system. Mocking is especially useful in unit and
integration testing to ensure tests remain focused, fast and
reliable.</p>
<p>For example, if a function modifies data and writes it to a file, you
can mock the file-writing object, so instead of creating an actual file,
the mocked object stores the “written” data. This enables you to verify
that the data written is as expected, without actually creating a file,
making tests more controlled and efficient.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p><a href="./20-introduction.html">Code style and linting</a> are
essential practices in code testing, as they help ensure that code is

<p><a href="././60-introduction.html">Continuous Integration (CI)</a>

<p>FIXME: copy factorial-example repo into softwaresaved</p>
<p>For this lesson we’ll be using some example code available on GitHub,
which we’ll clone onto our machines using the Bash shell. So firstly
open a Bash shell (via Git Bash in Windows or Terminal on a Mac). Then,
on the command line, navigate to where you’d like the example code to
reside, and use Git to clone it. For example, to clone the repository in
our home directory, and change our directory to the repository
contents:</p>

<p>Next, let’s take a look at the code, which is in the
<code>factorial-example/mymath directory</code>, called
<code>factorial.py</code>, so open this file in an editor.</p>
<p>The example code is a basic Python implementation of Factorial.
Essentially, it multiplies all the whole numbers from a given number
down to 1 e.g. given 3, that’s 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 - so the factorial of 3 is
6.</p>
<p>We can also run this code from within Python to show it working. In
the shell, ensure you are in the root directory of the repository, then
type:</p>

<p>Then at the prompt, import the <code>factorial</code> function from
the <code>mymath</code> library and run it:</p>

<p>Which gives us 6 - which gives us some evidence that this function is
working. Of course, in practice, our functions may well be more
complicated than this, and of course, they may call other separate
functions. Now we could just come up with a list of known input numbers
and expected outputs and run each of these manually to test the code,
but this would take some time. Computers are really good at one thing -
automation - so let’s use that and automate our tests, to make it easy

<p>Now, we using a Python unit test framework called
<code>unittest</code>. There are other such frameworks for Python,
including <code>nose</code> and <code>pytest</code> which is very
popular, but the advantage of using <code>unittest</code> is that it’s
already built-in to Python so it’s easier for us to use it.</p>
<p>Before we look into this example unit test, questions <em>Who here is
familiar with object oriented programming?</em> Yes/No <em>Who’s written
an object oriented program?</em> Yes/No</p>
<div id="what-is-object-oriented-programming" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">

</div>
<div id="what-is-object-oriented-programming" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">What is Object Oriented Programming?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>For those that aren’t familiar with object oriented programming, it’s
a way of structuring your programs around the <em>data</em> of your
problem. It’s based around the concept of objects, which are structures
that contain both data and functions that operate on that data. In
object oriented programming, objects are used to model real-world
entities, such as people, bank accounts, libraries, books, even
molecules, and so on. With each object having its own:</p>
<ul>
<li>data - known as attributes</li>
<li>functions - known as methods</li>
</ul>
<p>These are encapsulated within a defined structure known as a class.
An introduction to object oriented programming is beyond the scope of
this session, but if you’d like to know more there’s a great <a href="https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/" class="external-link">introductory
tutorial</a> on the <a href="https://realpython.com/" class="external-link">RealPython</a>
site. This site is a great practical resource for learning about how to
do many things in Python!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>For the purposes of this activity, we use object oriented classes to
encapsulate our unit tests since that’s how they’re defined in the
<code>unittest</code> framework. You can consider them as a kind of
syntactic sugar to group our tests together, 2ith a single unit test
being represented as a single function - or method - within a class.</p>
<p>In this example, we have a class called
<code>TestFactorialFunctions</code> with a single unit test, which we’ve
called <code>test_3</code>. Within that test method, we are essentially
doing what we did when we ran it manually earlier: we’re running
factorial with the argument 3, and checking it equals 6. We use an
inbuilt function, or method, in this class called
<code>assertEqual</code>, that checks the two are the same, and if not,
the test will fail.</p>
<p>So how do we run this test? In the shell, we can run this test by
ensuring we’re in the repository’s root directory, and running:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb6">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK</code></pre>
</div>
<p>[CHECKPOINT - who’s run the tests and got this output? Yes/No]</p>
<p>So what happens? We see a single <code>.</code>, we see a message
that says it ran very quickly, and <code>OK</code>. The single dot means
the single test we have was successfully run, so our test passes!</p>
<p>But how does unittest know what to run exactly? Unit test frameworks
like <code>unitttest</code> follow a common pattern of finding tests and
running them. When we give a single file argument to
<code>unittest</code>, it searches the Python file for
<code>unittest.TestCase</code> classes, and within those classes, looks
for methods starting with <code>test_</code>, and runs them. So we could
add more tests in this class in the same way, and it would run each in
turn. We could even add multiple <code>unittest.TestCase</code> classes
here if we wanted, each testing different aspects of our code for
example, and <code>unittest</code> would search all of these classes and
run each <code>test_</code> function in turn.</p>

<p>We’ve seen what happens if a test succeeds, but what happens if a
test fails? Let’s deliberately change our test to be wrong and find out,
by editing the <code>tests/test_factorial.py</code> file, changing the
expected result of <code>factorial(3)</code> to be <code>10</code>, and
saving the file.</p>
<p>We’ll rerun our tests slightly differently than last time:</p>

<p>We can see the tests pass. So the really useful thing here, is we can
rapidly add tests and rerun all of them. Particularly with more complex
codes that are harder to reason about, we can develop a set of tests
into a suite of tests to verify the codes’ correctness. Then, whenever
we make changes to our code, we can rerun our tests to make sure we
haven’t broken anything. An additional benefit is that successfully
running our unit tests can also give others confidence that our code
works as expected.</p>

<p>It turns out that our factorial function is <em>recursive</em>, which
means it calls itself. In order to compute the factorial of 10000, it
does that a lot. Python has a default limit for recursion of 1000, hence
the exception, which is a bit of a limitation in our implementation.
However, we can correct our implementation by changing it to use a
different method of calculating factorials that isn’t recursive. Edit
the <code>mymath/factorial.py</code> file and replace the function with
this one:</p>

<p>Make sure you replace the code in the <code>factorial.py</code> file,
and not the <code>test_factorial.py</code> file.</p>
<p>This is an <em>iterative</em> approach to solving factorial that
isn’t recursive, and won’t suffer from the previous issue. It simply
goes through the intended range of numbers and multiples it by a
previous running total each time, but doesn’t do it recursively by
calling itself. Notice that we’re not changing how the function is
called, or its intended behaviour. So we don’t need to change the Python
docstring here, since it still applies.</p>
<p>We now have our updated implementation, but we need to make sure it
works as intended. Fortunately, we have our set of tests, so let’s run
them again:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb7">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

test_5 (tests.test_factorial.TestFactorialFunctions) ... ok

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 0.000s

OK</code></pre>
</div>
<p>And they work, which gives us some confidence - very rapidly - that
our new implementation is behaving exactly the same as before. So again,
each time we change our code, whether it’s making small or large
changes, we retest and check they all pass</p>
<p>[CHECKPOINT - who managed to write unit test and run it? Yes/No]</p>
<div id="what-makes-a-good-test" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="what-makes-a-good-test" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">What makes a Good Test?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Of course, we only have 2 tests so far, and it would be good to have
more But what kind of tests are good to write? With more tests that
sufficiently test our code, the more confidence we have that our code is
correct. We could keep writing tests for e.g., 10, 15, 20, and so on.
But these become increasingly less useful, since they’re in much the
same “space”. We can’t test all positive numbers, and it’s fair to say
at a certain point, these types of low integers are sufficiently tested.
So what test cases should we choose?</p>
<p>We should select test cases that test two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The paths through our code, so we can check they work as we
expect. For example, if we had a number of paths through the code
dictated with if statements, we write tests to ensure those are
followed.</p></li>
<li><p>We also need to test the boundaries of the input data we expect
to use, known as <em>edge cases</em>. For example, if we go back to our
code. we can see that there are some interesting edge cases to test
for:</p></li>
<li><p>Zero?</p></li>
<li><p>Very large numbers (as we’ve already seen)?</p></li>
<li><p>Negative numbers?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All good candidates for further tests, since they test the code in
different ways, and test different paths through the code.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>But what do we do if our code is expected to throw an error? How
would we test for that?</p>
<p>Let’s try our code with a negative number, which we’ve already
identified as a good test case, from within the python interpreter:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb1">
<h3 class="code-label">PYTHON<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode python" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="im">from</span> mymath.factorial <span class="im">import</span> factorial</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> factorial(<span class="op">-</span><span class="dv">1</span>)</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>We can see that we get the result of 1, which is incorrect, since the
factorial function is undefined for negative numbers.</p>
<p>Perhaps what we want in this case is to test for negative numbers as
an invalid input, and display an exception if that is the case. How
would we implement that, and how would we test for the presence of an
exception?</p>
<p>In our implementation let’s add a check at the start of our function,
which is known as a <em>precondition</em>. The precondition will check
the validity of our input data before we do any processing on it, and
this approach to checking function input data is considered good
practice.</p>
<p>Edit the <code>mymath/factorial.py</code> file again, and add at the
start, below the docstring:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb2">
<h3 class="code-label">PYTHON<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode python" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> n <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="dv">0</span>:</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">raise</span> <span class="pp">ValueError</span>(<span class="st">'Only use non-negative integers.'</span>)</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>If we run it now, we should see our error:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb3">
<h3 class="code-label">PYTHON<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode python" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="im">from</span> mymath.factorial <span class="im">import</span> factorial</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> factorial(<span class="op">-</span><span class="dv">1</span>)</span></code></pre>
</div>
<div class="codewrapper">
<h3 class="code-label">OUTPUT<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="output" tabindex="0"><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "/home/steve/factorial-example/mymath/factorial.py", line 9, in factorial
    raise ValueError('Only use non-negative integers.')
ValueError: Only use non-negative integers.</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Sure enough, we get our exception as desired. But how do we test for
this in a unit test, since this is an exception, not a value?
Fortunately, unit test frameworks have ways to check for this.</p>
<p>Let’s add a new test to <code>tests/test_factorial.py</code>:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb5">
<h3 class="code-label">PYTHON<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode python" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="kw">def</span> test_negative(<span class="va">self</span>):</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" tabindex="-1"></a>        <span class="cf">with</span> <span class="va">self</span>.assertRaises(<span class="pp">ValueError</span>):</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" tabindex="-1"></a>          factorial(<span class="op">-</span><span class="dv">1</span>)</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>So here, we use <code>unittest</code>’s built-in
<code>assertRaises()</code> (instead of <code>assertEquals()</code>) to
test for a <code>ValueError</code> exception occurring when we run
<code>factorial(-1)</code>. We also use Python’s <code>with</code> here
to test for this within the call to <code>factorial()</code>. So if we
re-run our tests again, we should see them all succeed:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb6">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

</div>
<p>You should see:</p>
<div class="codewrapper">
<h3 class="code-label">OUTPUT<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

<p>Doing tasks manually can be time-consuming, error-prone, and hard to

reliably, quickly, and consistently, freeing up your time for more
valuable and creative work.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Automation is the process of using scripts or tools to perform tasks
without manual intervention. In software development, automation helps
streamline repetitive or complex tasks, such as running tests, building
software, or processing data.</p>
<p>By automating these actions, you save time, reduce the chance of
human error, and ensure that processes are reproducible and consistent.
Automation also provides a clear, documented way to understand how
things are run, making it easier for others to replicate or build upon
your work.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="intro-to-continuous-integration">Intro to Continuous Integration<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#intro-to-continuous-integration"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Building on the concept of automation, Continuous Integration (CI) is
the practice of regularly integrating code changes into a shared code
repository and automatically running tasks and key checks each time this
happens (e.g. when changes are merged from development or feature branch
into main, or even after each commit). This helps maintain code quality
and ensures new contributions do not break existing functionality.</p>
<p>A variety of CI services and tools, like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI,
or Jenkins, make it easy to set up automated workflows triggered by code
changes.</p>
<p>CI can also be extended into Continuous Delivery (CD), which
automates the release or deployment of code to production or staging
environments.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="principles-of-ci">Principles of CI<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#principles-of-ci"></a>
</h3>
<p>Software development typically progresses in incremental steps and
requires a significant time investment. It is not realistic to expect a
complete, feature-rich application to emerge from a blank page in a
single step. The process often involves collaboration among multiple
developers, especially in larger projects where various components and
features are developed concurrently.</p>
<p>Continuous Integration (CI) is based on the principle that software
development is an incremental process involving ongoing contributions
from one or more developers. Integrating large changes is often more
complex and error-prone than incorporating smaller, incremental updates.
So, rather than waiting to integrate large, complex changes all at once,
CI encourages integrating small updates frequently to check for
conflicts and inconsistencies and ensure all parts of the codebase work
well together at all times. This becomes even more critical for larger
projects, where multiple features may be developed in parallel - CI
helps manage the complexity of merging such contributions by making
integrations a regular, manageable part of the workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="common-ci-tasks">Common CI Tasks<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#common-ci-tasks"></a>
</h3>
<p>When code is integrated, a range of tasks can be carried out
automatically to ensure quality and consistency, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>compiling the code</li>
<li>running a test suite across multiple platforms to catch issues early
and checking test coverage to see what tests are missing</li>
<li>verifying that the code adheres to project, team, or language style
guidelines with linters</li>
<li>building documentation pages from docstrings (structured
documentation embedded in the code) or other source pages,</li>
<li>other custom tasks, depending on project needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>These steps are typically executed as part of a structured sequence
known as the “CI pipeline”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="why-use-ci">Why use CI?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-use-ci"></a>
</h3>
<p>From what we have covered so far, it is clear that CI offers several
advantages that can significantly improve the software development
process.</p>
<p>It saves time and effort for you and your team by automating routine
checks and tasks, allowing you to focus on development rather than
manual verification.</p>
<p>CI also promotes good development practices by enforcing standards.
For instance, many projects are configured to reject changes unless all
CI checks pass.</p>
<p>Modern CI services make it easy to run its tasks and checks across
multiple platforms, operating systems, and software versions, providing
capabilities far beyond what could typically be achieved with local
infrastructure and manual testing.</p>
<p>While there can be a learning curve when first setting up CI, a wide
variety of tools are available, and the core principles are transferable
between them, making these valuable and broadly applicable skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="ci-services-tools">CI Services &amp; Tools<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ci-services-tools"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are a wide range of CI-focused workflow services and different
tools available to support various aspects of a CI pipeline. Many of
these services have Web-based interfaces and run on cloud
infrastructure, providing easy access to scalable, platform-independent
pipelines. However, local and self-hosted options are also available for
projects that require more control or need to operate in secure
environments. Most CI tools are generally language- and tool-agnostic;
if you can run a task locally, you can likely incorporate it into a CI
pipeline.</p>
<p>Popular cloud-based services include <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" class="external-link">GitHub Actions</a>, <a href="https://www.travis-ci.com/" class="external-link">Travis CI</a>, <a href="https://circleci.com/" class="external-link">CircleCI</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/" class="external-link">TeamCity</a>, while

<h3 id="beyond-ci---continuous-deploymentdelivery">Beyond CI - Continuous Deployment/Delivery<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#beyond-ci---continuous-deploymentdelivery"></a>
</h3>
<p>You may frequently come across the term CI/CD, which refers to the
combination of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment or
Delivery (CD).</p>
<p>While CI focuses on integrating and testing code changes, CD extends
the process by automating the delivery and deployment of software. This
can include building installation packages for various environments and
automatically deploying updates to test or production systems. For
example, a web application could be redeployed every time a new change
passes the CI pipeline (an example is this website - it is rebuilt each
time a change is made to one of its <a href="https://github.com/softwaresaved/byte-sized-rse" class="external-link">source
pages</a>).</p>
<p>CD helps streamline the release process for packages or applications,
for example by doing nightly builds and deploying them to a public
server for download, making it easier and faster to get working updates
into the hands of users with minimal manual intervention.</p>

<p>FIXME: copy factorial-example repo into softwaresaved</p>
<p>For this lesson we’ll need to create a new GitHub repository based on
the contents of another repository.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Once logged into GitHub in a web browser, go to <a href="https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/ci-example" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/ci-example</a>.</li>
<li>Select ‘Use this template’, and then select ‘Create a new
repository’ from the dropdown menu.</li>
<li>On the next screen, ensure your personal GitHub account is selected
in the <code>Owner</code> field, and fill in
<code>Repository name</code> with <code>ci-example</code>.</li>
<li>Ensure the repository is set to <code>Public</code>.</li>
<li>Select <code>Create repository</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should be presented with the new repository’s main page. Next, we
need to clone this repository onto our own machines, using the Bash
shell. So firstly open a Bash shell (via Git Bash in Windows or Terminal
on a Mac). Then, on the command line, navigate to where you’d like the
example code to reside, and use Git to clone it. For example, to clone
the repository in our home directory (replacing
<code>github-account-name</code> with our own account), and change
directory to the repository contents:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb1">

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Next, let’s take a look at the code, which is in the
<code>factorial-example/mymath directory</code>, called
<code>factorial.py</code>, so open this file in an editor. You may
recall we used this example in the last session on unit testing.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the example code is a basic Python implementation of
Factorial. Essentially, it multiplies all the whole numbers from a given
number down to 1 e.g. given 3, that’s 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 - so the factorial
of 3 is 6.</p>
<p>We can also run this code from within Python to show it working. In
the shell, ensure you are in the root directory of the repository, then
type:</p>

the <code>mymath</code> library and run it:</p>

<p>Which gives us 6 - which gives us some evidence that this function is
working. But this isn’t really enough evidence to give us confidence in
its overall correctness.</p>

<p>For this reason, this code repository already has a series of unit

<p>The key difference when writing tests for <code>pytest</code> as
opposed to <code>unittest</code>, is that we don’t need to worry about
wrapping the tests in a class: we only need to write functions for each
test, which is a bit simpler. But they otherwise essentially work very
similarly in both frameworks.</p>
<p>So essentially, this series of tests will check whether calling our
<code>factorial</code> function gives us the correct result, given a
variety of inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>factorial(3)</code> should give us 6</li>
<li>
<code>factorial(5)</code> should give us 120</li>
<li>
<code>factorial(-1)</code> should raise a Python
<code>ValueError</code> which we need to check for</li>

<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#setting-up-a-virtual-environment-for-pytest"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>So how do we run these tests? Well, we need to create a virtual
environment, since we’re using a unit test framework that’s supplied by
another Python library which we need to have access to.</p>
<p>You may remember we used virtual environments previously. So in
summary, we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new virtual environment to hold packages</li>
<li>Activate that new virtual environment</li>
<li>Install <code>pytest</code> into our new virtual environment</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>

<p>Then to activate it:</p>

</div>
<p>Then, in the shell, we can run these tests by ensuring we’re in the
repository’s root directory, and running the following (very similar to
how we ran our previous <code>unittest</code> tests):</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now before we move on to defining our workflow in GitHub Actions,
we’ll take a very brief look at a language used to describe its
workflows, called YAML.</p>
<p>Originally, the acronym stood for <em>Yet Another Markup
Language</em>, but since it’s not actually used for document markup,
it’s acronym meaning was changed to <em>YAML Aint Markup
Language</em>.</p>
<p>Essentially, YAML is based around key value pairs, for example:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb1">
<h3 class="code-label">YAML<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode yaml" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">name</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> Kilimanjaro</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">height_metres</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> </span><span class="dv">5892</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">first_scaled_by</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> Hans Meyer</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now we can also define more complex data structures too. Using YAML
arrays, for example, we could define more than one entry for
<code>first_scaled_by</code>, by replacing it with:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb2">
<h3 class="code-label">YAML<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode yaml" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">first_scaled_by</span><span class="kw">:</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="kw">-</span><span class="at"> Hans Meyer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="kw">-</span><span class="at"> Ludwig Purtscheller</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note that similarly to languages like Python, YAML uses spaces for
indentation (2 spaces is recommended). Also, in YAML, arrays are
sequences, where the order is preserved.</p>
<p>There’s also a short form for arrays:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb3">
<h3 class="code-label">YAML<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode yaml" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">first_scaled_by</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> </span><span class="kw">[</span><span class="at">Hans Meyer</span><span class="kw">,</span><span class="at"> Ludwig Purtscheller</span><span class="kw">]</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>We can also define nested, hierarchical structures too, using YAML
<em>maps</em>. For example:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb4">
<h3 class="code-label">YAML<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode yaml" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">name</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> Kilimanjaro</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">height</span><span class="kw">:</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="fu">value</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> </span><span class="dv">5892</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="fu">unit</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> metres</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="fu">measured</span><span class="kw">:</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">    </span><span class="fu">year</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> </span><span class="dv">2008</span></span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">    </span><span class="fu">by</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> Kilimanjaro 2008 Precise Height Measurement Expedition</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>We are also able to combine maps and arrays, for example:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb5">
<h3 class="code-label">YAML<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode yaml" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">first_scaled_by</span><span class="kw">:</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="kw">-</span><span class="at"> </span><span class="fu">name</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> Hans Meyer</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">    </span><span class="fu">date_of_birth</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> 22-03-1858</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">    </span><span class="fu">nationality</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> German</span></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="kw">-</span><span class="at"> </span><span class="fu">name</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> Ludwig Purtscheller</span></span>

<span id="cb5-7"><a href="#cb5-7" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">    </span><span class="fu">nationality</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> Austrian</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>So that’s a very brief tour of YAML, which demonstrates what we need
to know to write GitHub Actions workflows.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="enabling-workflows-for-our-repository">Enabling Workflows for our Repository<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#enabling-workflows-for-our-repository"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>So let’s now create a new GitHub Actions CI workflow for our new
repository that runs our unit tests whenever a change is made.</p>
<p>Firstly, we should ensure GitHub Actions is enabled for repository.
In a browser:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go the main page for the <code>ci-example</code> repository you
created in GitHub.</li>
<li>Go to repository <code>Settings</code>.</li>
<li>From the sidebar on the left select <code>General</code>, then
<code>Actions</code> (and under that, <code>General</code>).</li>
<li>Under <code>Actions permissions</code>, ensure
<code>Allow all actions and reusable workflows</code> is selected,
otherwise, our workflows won’t run!</li>
</ol></section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="creating-our-first-workflow">Creating Our First Workflow<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-our-first-workflow"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Next, we need to create a new file in our repository to contain our
workflow, and it needs to be located in a particular directory location.
We’ll create this directly using the GitHub interface, since we’re
already there:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go back to the repository main page in GitHub.</li>
<li>Select <code>Add file</code> (you may need to expand your browser
Window to see <code>Add file</code>) then
<code>Create new file</code>.</li>
<li>We need to add the workflow file within two nested subdirectories,
since that’s where GitHub will look for it. In filename text box, add
<code>.github</code> then add <code>/</code>. This will allow us to
continue adding directories or a filename as needed.</li>
<li>Add <code>workflows</code>, and <code>/</code> again.</li>
<li>Add <code>main.yml</code>.</li>
<li>Should end up with
<code>ci-example / .github / workflow / main.yml in main</code> in the
file field.</li>
<li>Select anywhere in the <code>Edit new file</code> window to start
creating the file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that GitHub Actions expects workflows to be contained within the
<code>.github/workflows</code> directory.</p>
<p>Let’s build up this workflow now.</p>
<p>FIXME: turn the below into a step-by-step learning narrative,
explaining each bit</p>
<p>So first let’s specify a name for our workflow that will appear under
GitHub Actions build reports, and add the conditions that will trigger
the workflow to run:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb6">
<h3 class="code-label">YAML<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

<pre class="sourceCode yaml" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">name</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> run-unit-tests</span></span>

</div>
<p>So here our workflow will run when changes are pushed to the
repository. There are <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows" class="external-link">other
events</a> we might specify instead (or as well) if we wanted, but this
is the most common.</p>
<p>GitHub Actions are described as a sequence of jobs (such as building
our code, or running some tests), and each job contains a sequence of
steps which each represent a specific “action” (such as running a
command, or obtaining code from a repository).</p>
<p>Let’s define the start of a workflow job we’ll name
<code>build-and-test</code>:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb7">
<h3 class="code-label">YAML<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

<pre class="sourceCode yaml" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">jobs</span><span class="kw">:</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="fu">build-and-test</span><span class="kw">:</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">    </span><span class="fu">runs-on</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> ubuntu-latest</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>We only have one job in this workflow, but we may have many. We also
specify the operating systems on which we want this job to run. In this
case, only the latest version of Linux Ubuntu, but we could supply
others too (such as Windows, or Mac OS) which we’ll see later.</p>
<p>When the workflow is triggered, our job will run within a
<code>runner</code>, which you can think of as a freshly installed
instance of a machine running the operating system we indicate (in this
case Ubuntu).</p>
<p>Let’s now supply the concrete things we want to do in our workflow.
We can think of this as the things we need to set up and run on a fresh
machine. So within our workflow, we’ll need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out our code repository</li>
<li>Install Python</li>
<li>Install our Python dependencies (which is just <code>pytest</code>
in this case)</li>
<li>Run <code>pytest</code> over our set of tests</li>
</ul>
<p>We can define these as follows:</p>

<p>We first use GitHub Actions (indicated by
<code>uses: actions/</code>), which are small tools we use to perform
something specific. In this case, we use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>checkout</code> - to checkout the repository into our
runner</li>
<li>
<code>setup-python</code> - to set up a specific version of
Python</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the <code>name</code> entries are descriptive text and can
be anything, but it’s good to make them meaningful since they are what
will appear in our build reports as we’ll see later.</p>

<p>Here we use two <code>run</code> steps to run some specific commands,
to install our python dependencies and run <code>pytest</code> over our
tests, using <code>-v</code> to request verbose reporting.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Our workflow here uses standard GitHub Actions (indicated by
<code>actions/*</code>). Beyond the standard set of actions, others are
available via the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/developers/github-marketplace/github-marketplace-overview" class="external-link">GitHub
Marketplace</a>. It contains many third-party actions (as well as apps)
that you can use with GitHub for many tasks across many programming
languages, particularly for setting up environments for running tests,
code analysis and other tools, setting up and using infrastructure (for
things like Docker or Amazon’s AWS cloud), or even managing repository
issues. You can even contribute your own.</p>

this into our repository:</p>

<li>Add in a commit message, e.g. “Initial workflow to run tests on

<p>This commit action will now trigger the running of this new workflow,
