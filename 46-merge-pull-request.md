## Read Review and Merge the Pull Request

Now - final step
Back to our role as contributor...
We created our own pull request, that hopefully another participant (or ourselves) has reviewed

Let's take a look, by going back to our repository, and looking at our own pull request, and looking at the review
We should now consider the review, and any observations or suggestions made
At this point, we could go ahead and make any needed changes
But, for simplicity, and assuming their review is positive (and they don't suggest more changes are required)
We can go ahead and merge the pull request into our codebase
By selecting 'Merge pull request', and then “Confirm Merge”

So now, our change has been integrated into our codebase

QUESTION: Who's read the other participants' review of their PR, and merged it? Yes/No

## Housekeeping

But - there's a bit of housekeeping we should do
The pull request branch is no longer needed, everything's been merged
So let's keep a tidy repository and delete the branch
If we go to our repo's main page, and select 'branches'
We can delete our pull request branch
