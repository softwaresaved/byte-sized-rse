# Byte-sized RSE

[Byte-sized RSE](https://www.universe-hpc.ac.uk/events/byte-sized-rse/) is a series of standalone mini training materials providing key research software skills in around 1-1.5 hour run by the [UNIVERSE-HPC](https://www.universe-hpc.ac.uk/) project since October 2022. There have been 3 Byte-sized RSE series so far, each with a number of episodes. Each episode also has a companion podcast episode in the Code for Thought podcast series.

Check [Byte-sized RSE series](https://www.universe-hpc.ac.uk/events/byte-sized-rse/) for the full list of all episodes.

This repository contains a subset of the [original Byte-sized RSE episodes](https://www.universe-hpc.ac.uk/events/byte-sized-rse/) (currently mainly available as a set of slides) transcribed in the [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench] format suitable for the delivery by instructors familiar with the episode content. 

## Episode format

Each episode is standalone, although it may require some prerequisite knowledge which is clearly described at the beginning. Episodes start with a setup for that episode, introduction and motivation, which is then followed by a practical hands-on part.
