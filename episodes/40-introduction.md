This session introduces key practices for effective coding and collaboration within research software projects. You will learn how to work together on code through structured approaches such as code review, understand common workflows and tools that support collaborative development, and explore the processes that help maintain code quality and team productivity. We will then take a practical look at how to carry out code reviews using GitHub, one of the most widely used platforms for collaborative software development.

## Introduction to Coding within a Collaboration

Software development thrives on collaboration, even when much of the coding is done individually. Getting input from others can have a big impact on the quality, maintainability, and effectiveness of your work, often requiring only a small investment of time. Since there is rarely a single “perfect” way to solve a problem, working with others allows you to share knowledge, skills, and perspectives, leading to better solutions and new insights. Through collaboration, you can learn new techniques, discover tools and infrastructure that streamline development, and help build a shared understanding that benefits the wider team or community.

There are many benefits to coding with others. Collaborative coding practices — such as pair programming, code reviews, and shared repositories — can help catch bugs earlier, improve code readability, and increase overall code quality. It also fosters shared ownership of the codebase, making it easier for teams to maintain and extend code over time.

Importantly, it is best to adopt collaborative tools and practices before they become urgent. Setting up processes, code sharing and collaboration platforms (like GitHub or GitLab), and development workflows early on means you will be ready to handle code review, version control, and team communication smoothly when collaboration intensifies. Early investment in collaboration infrastructure pays off by preventing confusion and bottlenecks later in a project.

## Intro to code review
