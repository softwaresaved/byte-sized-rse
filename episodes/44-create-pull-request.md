## Creating a Pull Request

But - we still need to submit this new branch and the commit we made as a pull request
And GitHub nicely guides us to doing this
Select "Create pull request"

Once we've done that, we can see that our pull request has been opened
And is ready for consideration to be merged into the codebase
For information, we can see that GitHub is aware that the change we've committed can be merged directly - without conflicts - into our main branch
We could optionally add more info about this pull request here in comments if we wanted

QUESTION: who's been able to create a new pull request? Yes/No

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Swap Repository with Someone Else

For the next stage, you'll be reviewing a pull request. Either:

- If you are attending a workshop with other learners,
the instructor will enable you to swap the URL of your repository with the repository URL of another learner so you can review the pull request they made on their own repository.
- If you are going through this material on your own,
you can review the pull request you made on your own repository instead.
