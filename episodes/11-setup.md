## Setup

### VS Code

The hands-on part of this topic will be conducted using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), a widely used IDE.
Please [download the appropriate version of Visual Studio Code][vs-code] for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and system architecture (e.g., 64-bit, ARM).

### Bash shell with Git version control tool installed

On macOS and Linux, a bash shell will be available by default.
        On Linux you may need to use your system package manager to install git.
        On Windows you can install Git for Windows to provide both Git and a bash shell.
        Type `git` and press enter at your shell prompt to check if git is installed. It should display 'usage: git â€¦' followed by a set of help instructions.

### Python

Python version 3.8 or above is required. Type `python -v` at your shell prompt and press enter to see what version of Python is installed on your system. 
If you do not have Python installed on your system and require assistance with the installation, you can take a look at [the instructions provided by Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/#install-python) 
for installing Python in preparation for undertaking their Python lesson.
