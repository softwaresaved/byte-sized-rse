## Setup

### Shell with Git

On macOS and Linux, a bash shell will be available by default.

If you do not have a bash shell installed on your system and require assistance with the installation, you can take a look at [the instructions provided by Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/#install-python) 
for installing [shell](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#the-bash-shell) and [Git](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#git-1).

### Python

Python version 3.8 or above is required. Type `python -v` at your shell prompt and press enter to see what version of Python is installed on your system. 
If you do not have Python installed on your system and require assistance with the installation, you can take a look at [the instructions provided by Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/#install-python) 
for installing Python in preparation for undertaking their Python lesson.
    
### VS Code

The hands-on part of this topic will be conducted using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), a widely used IDE.
Please [download the appropriate version of Visual Studio Code][vs-code] for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and system architecture (e.g., 64-bit, ARM).
