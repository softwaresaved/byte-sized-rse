## Read Review and Merge the Pull Request

Now we return to our role as code contributor.

As owner of your PR, the next step involves addressing any feedback made by the reviewer.
Return to the PR you created earlier,
and take a look at the comments that will appear in the `Conversation` tab.
You may need to scroll down to see them.

We should now consider the review and any observations or suggestions made,
and make any needed changes.
To add these changes, we'd add new commits to the PR branch,
but for simplicity, let's assume our reviewer fully endorsed our PR.
We can go ahead and merge the pull request into our codebase,
by selecting `Merge pull request`, and then `Confirm Merge`.

So now, our change has been integrated into our codebase!
You'll notice that the branch you created earlier has been deleted by GitHub,
since it is no longer needed.

QUESTION: Who's read the other participants' review of their PR, and merged it? Yes/No

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Following a merge, pull request branches are deleted in keeping with the short-lived branch philosophy of GitHub
