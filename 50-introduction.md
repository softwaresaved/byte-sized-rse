Testing is a critical part of writing reliable, maintainable code — especially in collaborative or research environments where reproducibility and correctness are key. In this session, we will explore why testing matters, and introduce different levels of testing — from small, focused unit tests, to broader integration and system tests that check how components work together. We will also look at testing approaches such as regression testing (to ensure changes do not break existing behavior) and property-based testing (to test a wide range of inputs automatically). Finally, we will cover mocking, a technique used to isolate code during tests by simulating the behavior of external dependencies.


## Intro to testing

- Why test your code?
- Types of testing - levels (unit, integration, system)
- Types of testing - approaches (regression testing, property-based testing)
- Mocking
